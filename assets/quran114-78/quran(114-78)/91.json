      "note": "1a. Al-shams, or the sun, is feminine, and al-qamar, or the moon, masculine, in theArabic language, as opposed to English. Óu√å is the early part of the forenoon aftersunrise, or the advanced state of the day, or when the sun shines brightly (LL). This is toshow that the spiritual light of the Prophet will brighten as time passes on.\n\n2a. Talå-hå literally signifies it followed him, but this is sometimes in one thing following another in body, and sometimes in imitating in respect of predicament (R); hereit is explained as meaning following it in the way of imitation and in respect of rank,because it borrows light from the sun (R). Farrå’ takes this to be the real meaning, for hesays, such a one follows such a one in respect of such a thing, meaning he takes fromhim (Rz).\n\n3a. The commentators take the personal pronoun in jallå-hå (“exposes it”) as referring to the world, though it is not mentioned here, because, as Kf says, in such cases themeaning is clear, as they say, it was cold, meaning the morning, though they do not mention it in words (Rz).\n\n4a. The personal pronoun in yaghshå-hå (“draws a veil over it”) also refers to theworld.\n\n7a. The må in vv. 5–7 is either ma©dariyyah, as in the translation (“its”), ormau©∂lah, as referring to the Divine Being, for må is often used to indicate the majestyof the person spoken of; the meaning in this case would be: And the heaven and HimWho built it, and the earth and Him Who spread it. The mention of the perfection of thesoul of man in this verse is a sequel to what is stated in the first six verses. Man is herespoken of as possessing the highest of qualities which are met with in nature. The sun isa source of light, even so is the perfect man a source of spiritual light. The moon borrows the light of the sun, even so is the perfect man, whose light is really borrowed fromthe Divine source, which is the real source of all light. The day makes things manifestand thus enables man to carry on his struggle, while the night casts a veil over light andbrings rest; the perfect man possesses both these qualities, as he carries on a very hardstruggle for the attainment of great ends, and at the same time his mind is at rest and hepossesses the quality of contentment. The heaven is raised high, and the earth is spreadout for men to walk over, being thus a manifestation of humility; the perfect man possesses both these qualities, having the highest of aspirations and being at the same timehumble and lowly. The perfect man thus possesses the opposite qualities of giving lightand receiving light, severe exertion and complete rest, greatness and humility. Thesequalities were possessed by the Prophet, who invited others to make the same the goal oftheir lives.\n\n8a. The verse is a fitting sequel to the statement made in the previous verse asregards the perfection of the soul, as it points out the way to perfection. It is throughilhåm, Divine inspiration, or revelation, that the soul is made perfect, because Divinerevelation makes clear, the two ways, fuj∂r, or the way of deviation from the Truth, i.e.,the way of evil, and taqwå, or the way of observance of duty, or the way of good. It is byavoiding the former and walking in the latter that perfection can be attained. BothRodwell and Palmer are wrong here in translating the verse as meaning, “And breathedinto it its wickedness and its piety” (Rodwell), “taught it its sin and its piety” (Palmer),for the statement in this form is not only contradicted by the whole of the Qur’ån, but isalso self-contradictory and meaningless. Ilhåm always signifies an intimation by inspiration from the Divine Being, or Divine revelation. “And this is peculiar to that which isintimated by Allåh” (R). Rz says the intimation by inspiration of good and evil meansthe making a man to understand and know them both, and he adds that this explanationis accepted by I‘Ab and all trustworthy commentators.\n\n10a. Zakkå is from zakå, meaning it increased, and therefore primarily the word signifies he made it to increase or thrive, and dasså-hå means he hid it or concealed it, orburied it (LL). The secondary meaning of the former is he purified it, and that of the latter he corrupted it. The adoption of these two words really indicates that the facultiesnecessary for perfection are given to every man, but there are some who make themthrive by their development and others who corrupt them by allowing them to remainconcealed, not displaying them to their advantage.\n\n11a. The verse gives an instance of those whose end is failure on account of the corrupt manner of their lives, giving at the same time a warning to men that, if they continued in their evil course and did not turn to righteousness, following the call of theProphet, their end would be the same. If they followed the Prophet, they would attain toperfection, but, if they went against him, they would be given over to destruction aswere the former people.\n\n15a. Allåh does not care for the consequences of the punishment to a people whenthey are found deserving of such punishment, for through their destruction comes life tohumanity."
