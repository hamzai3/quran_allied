	  "note": "5a. The first verse speaks of a violent shaking of the earth. For the significance ofzalzalah or shaking, see 22:1a. That such a shaking would take place at the Resurrectioncannot be denied. That it took place in the Prophet’s lifetime is a fact. This was theshaking which brought about that wonderful transformation in Arabia, and then in thewhole world, which is spoken of in the last chapter. The second verse speaks of the earthas bringing forth her burdens. This has been taken as signifying both the bringing forthof the dead and the yielding of her hidden treasures (RM). How the earth is bringingforth her hidden treasures of mineral wealth shows the wonderful knowledge of thefuture disclosed in the Qur’ån. That these are the preliminaries of a great transformationis the one theme of these early revelations. The transformation brought about in theProphet’s lifetime was in fact the first stage in the greater transformation to be broughtabout in the whole world later on, the åkhirah of 93:4, for which see 93:5a. The mightyworld-conflicts of our day and the unimaginable treasures brought forth in these days arein fact portents of what must follow, the spiritual awakening to be brought about in theworld. Vv. 3 – 5 indicate that, at the happenings referred to in the first two verses, manwill wonder and cry out, what has befallen the earth? This shows that extraordinaryhappenings will be witnessed by man in this very life. The earth will tell her news, thatis to say, great secrets hitherto unknown will be revealed. This is further stressed in v. 5,as if thy Lord had revealed to her. In other words, as revelation discloses things whichare unknown to man, so will great secrets hitherto unknown be revealed. Maybe there isa deeper reference here that in the wake of these extraordinary happenings will come ageneral spiritual awakening, as if God had revealed to the earth itself.\n\n8a. Men will be shown their works in the Resurrection by being made to taste oftheir fruits, but they can also see the good or evil of their works in this life. Good andevil, when practised on a large scale, bring their reward or requital in this life as well.Note that the words here are he who does, and thus include both the Muslim and thenon-Muslim. Even a non-Muslim who does an atom’s weight of good will have itsreward, and a Muslim who does an atom’s weight of evil will be requited for it."
