	  "note": "6a. ‘Ådiyåt (from ‘adw, to run) are those running, as also assaulters, and ˙ab√ is theuttering of sound in running fast (R). M∂riyåt (from warå, it produced fire) are thosethat produce fire, and qad√ carries a number of significations, among these being making a crack or a hole or corrosion or an act of striking fire (LL). Mughßråt is fromaghåra meaning he hastened or ran fast or vehemently or made a sudden attack (LL).There is much difference of opinion as to what is meant by these words. According toI‘Ab, these words describe the condition of the camels running on the occasion of thepilgrimage, but the majority of the commentators interpret these as meaning horses, thereference being to the part they play in war (RM). In this case it would be a propheticaldescription of the wars through which the opponents, who wanted to destroy Truth bythe sword, were ultimately to be brought low. The words are so wide that they may alsoapply to modern means of warfare. If the strength of an attack on the enemy dependedon the swiftness with which the attack was made, and therefore, in days gone by, on thestriking force of its horse, the words describe even more fittingly the air attacks of ourown days. They, too, make a sound and throw out fire causing holes and fissures andsplitting the earth. They, too, attack in the early hours of the morning, raise dust fromdemolished buildings and penetrate into the thickest parts of the towns. Others understand that these are groups of spiritual wayfarers, who run fast in the way of God. Man’sungratefulness to his Lord and his excessive love of wealth is the real theme in all cases.He sees only the material side of life and does not pay heed to its spiritual values. Thebalance of life is thus upset. Disasters come and he is violently shaken so that his eyesmay be opened to the real values of life.\n\n11a. A day will come, we are told, when those in the graves — the dead — will beraised to life and what is hidden in the breasts — the deeds which man did, hiding themfrom the eyes of others — will be made manifest. God is Aware even now, but as innature, the consequences are made manifest in due time. They may not be as clear hereas they will be at the Resurrection, when the sight will be sharpened (50:22), but sometimes they are made manifest here, too."
