	  "note": "1a. The Arabs were an ummß people, a people who made no use of reading and writing, with very rare exceptions, and the Prophet himself did not know reading or writing,yet the very first revelation which he received from on High was a command to read.The significance of this order is expressed in v. 3, v. 2 being parenthetical as referring tothe origin of man. The order to read is repeated in v. 3 with the addition of the wordsthat thy Lord is most Generous, to show that it is through reading and writing that mancan attain to a position of glory, while v. 4 says that it is by the use of the pen thatknowledge can be acquired. The words in the name of thy Lord signify by the help of thyLord. The use of the word Rabb (Nourisher unto perfection) is to show that revelationwas being granted to the Prophet, to bring him, and through him the whole of humanity,to perfection. The circumstances attending this first revelation are met with in trustworthy reports, and from these it appears that the Holy Prophet’s first reply to the angel whobrought this message was that he was unable to read (B. 1:1).\n\n2a. ‘Alaq signifies a clot of blood as well as attachment and love (T, LL). The former significance is the one generally adopted, because of the mention of ‘alaqah in theprocess of the creation of man in other places in the Holy Qur’ån, and it indicates theinsignificance of man’s origin. Having regard to the other significance of ‘alaq, thewords may, however, also be translated as meaning created man out of love. TheProphet is reported to have said: I (God) loved that I should be known, so I created man.\n\n3a. Akram and Karßm (from karuma, it was highly esteemed or excellent or valuable) mean Generous as well as Honourable (LL). This word has been used here in reference to the great goal of honour and glory which the Prophet was destined to attain.\n\n4a. The mention of the pen in this, the very first, revelation of the Holy Prophet, issignificant, and it not only indicates, as Rodwell says, “the powerful help for propagatingthe knowledge of the Divine Unity” which the Holy Prophet was to find in the pen, butsignifies as well that the pen should be specially used in guarding the revelation whichwas to be granted to the Holy Prophet. It is a fact that the pen has played an importantpart in the propagation of Islåm as well as in the protection of the Qur’ån against corruption of every sort. The frequent mention of writing and the pen in the Holy Qur’ån, andparticularly in connection with the revelation of the Holy Prophet, is rather striking whenit is borne in mind that not only was the use of writing a rare novelty in the Arabianpeninsula, but the Prophet was himself unacquainted with writing and reading.\n\n7a. Some reports apply the words from here to the end of this chapter to Ab∂ Jahl,but the words are general. In fact, we are told here that man becomes inordinate or rebellious because he thinks himself to be self-sufficient, and free from all need of God Whobreathed into him of His Spirit. The soul of man has in fact a mystic relation with theinvisible Divine Spirit, which the materialist fails to realize.\n\n10a. There is special reference in the indefinite form to the Holy Prophet. So greatwas the opposition that the Prophet and his companions could not say their prayers in apublic place.\n\n15a. Seizing by the forelock signifies abasement. In the battle of Badr — thirteenyears after this — these opponents were actually abased.\n\n 18a. Al-nådß signifies al-majlis or the council. The dår al-Nadwah (from the sameroot nadå) was the great council-hall of the nation, where the chief men assembled together in consultation over matters of importance relating to the whole of the nation, the undertaking of wars, etc. The significance therefore is that they should take their decision unitedly and do their utmost against the Prophet and his message. The zabåniyah “with theArabs of the classical age” signifies the shuraΔ (LL, so also Kf, Bd, Rz), “applied in theearlier sense of the braves of an army, or in the later sense of the armed attendants of theprefect of police. This is the primary significance” (LL). The two verses thus clearly speakof the battles in which the mighty men of both sides were to be brought into conflict.\n\n19a. The recital of this verse is followed by an actual prostration; see 7:206a "
