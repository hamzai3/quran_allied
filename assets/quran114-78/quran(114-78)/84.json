      "note": "1a. The first five verses of this chapter speak of an ordinary phenomenon of nature,viz., the coming down of rain and the growth of vegetation, as a reference to the transformation which was to be brought about by the Divine revelation. The bursting asunderof heaven here stands for the coming down of rain; compare 25:25: “And on the daywhen the heaven bursts asunder with clouds”.\n\n2a. Adhina la-h∂ signifies he listened to him (LL). By the cloud or heaven listeningto its Lord here, and the earth listening to its Lord in v. 5, is meant their obedience toHis commandment. To both phrases is added the word √uqqat, signifying that they aremade suitable or fit for listening to and obeying the Divine commandments, i.e., it istheir very nature to be entirely submissive to the Divine commandments.\n\n3a. Madda-h∂ signifies he pulled it, strained it, extended it by drawing or pulling,stretched it, extended it (LL). The stretching of the earth signifies the same as its stirringand swelling in 22:5 and 41:39. “And of His signs is this, that thou seest the earth still,but when We send down water thereon, it stirs and swells” (41:39); see 41:39a, wherethe meaning is explained to be the producing of herbage, the expression here, as there,signifying metaphorically that Divine revelation gives spiritual life to man. The meaningof the earth being stretched is explained in the next verse: it casts forth what is in it andbecomes empty, i.e., the treasures of life latent within it are brought to light by the coming down of rain.\n\n6a. This is the conclusion to which a consideration of the first five verses leads. Manmust strive hard to attain to his Lord. Those who do this are ultimately joyful(v. 9), but those who give themselves up to the pleasures of this life (v. 13) shall afterwards be in a sad plight (v. 11).\n\n18a. Verses 16 –18 draw attention to another phenomenon of nature, thereby indicating the departure of the power of the opponents of Truth. The shafaq, or the sunsetredness, stands here for the disappearing sun of the power of the opponents, the night ofadversity, which was now to overtake them, driving before it what vestige of light hadremained. But they were not to remain submerged in darkness forever, for the moon (theHoly Prophet) had already made its appearance and would soon grow full, when theArab nation was to march forth to conquer the world, the moon being a symbol of thepower of the Arabs. For an alternative significance, see next note.\n\n19a. According to I‘Ab, this verse speaks of the advancement of the cause of theProphet (B. 65:84, 2). The people addressed here are thus the Muslims, who are told thatthey will go on making progress in the world, but it will be a gradual progress, and theremay be set-backs. But the ultimate state would be one of triumph. In this case the nightspoken of in the previous verse would mean the adversities which Islåm itself will haveto face, and the full moon would indicate its final triumph. The commentators alsoexplain this verse as being a prophecy of the ultimate triumph of Islåm (Rz).\n\n21a. An actual prostration follows the recital of this verse; see 7:206a."
