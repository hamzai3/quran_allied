	  "note": "3a. Dßn is generally taken here as meaning judgment, but I would prefer its morewell-known significance, religion. Not taking care of orphans and helping the needy isreally a denial of religion. Vv. 4 –7 make it clear that praying to God is useless, a mereshow, unless one is kind to orphans and helps the needy.\n\n5a. Being unmindful of prayer means not paying heed to the spirit of prayer, whichis described in the two previous verses as being the help of the orphan and the needy.\n\n7a. Al-Må‘∂n is explained by Bukhårß as meaning al-Ma‘r∂f kullu-h∂, i.e., everygood or kind deed. And it is added that according to ‘Ikrimah, its highest form is obligatory zakåt and lowest lending of a thing or giving any useful thing to another(B. 65:107). The root is ma‘n, which means a useful or easy thing. Having regard to whatis said in the opening verses, al-Må‘∂n includes all acts of kindness done to fellow-men."
