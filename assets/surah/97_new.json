      "note": "1a. Lailat al-Qadr, literally the Night of Majesty or Grandeur or Greatness, is a well-known night in the last ten days of the month of Ramaḍān, being more probably the 25th or 27th or 29th night of the month. In 44:3 it is called the blessed night. From 2:185, it appears that the Holy Qur’ān was revealed in the month of Ramaḍān, and from the above it appears to have been revealed on the lailat al-Qadr; by revelation of course being meant the commencement of its revelation, because the whole was revealed in portions during twenty-three years; and the word “Qur’ān” is applicable as well to a portion as to the whole. That the reference is here to the commencement of the revelation is also clear from the arrangement of the chapters, the opening verses of the last chapter being admittedly the first revelation to the Prophet. In fact, lailat al-Qadr owes its importance to the fact it was on this night that the most blessed and perfect of all revelations was vouchsafed to the world. Moses’ fasting for forty days previous to the receipt of revelation (Exod. 24:18), and Jesus’ keeping fast for the same number of days before he was called upon to undertake the office of prophethood (Matt. 4:2), show that Divine blessings are associated with fasting in sacred history. Hence the Muslims are required to fast every year for thirty days, and special Divine blessings are promised to them in the concluding days of the fasts.\n\n 3a. A thousand months may be taken as the equivalent of a very long time. Numerically they are equal to about 83 years, leaving 17 years to complete a century. There is a saying of the Holy Prophet according to which a mujaddid, or a reformer, will appear among the Muslims at the commencement of every century. The lailat al-Qadr being a time of great spiritual blessing may also signify the time during which the Prophet worked inperson, being actually a period of twenty-three years, or the time during which a mujaddid would ordinarily work, which period is more blessed spiritually than the rest of the century.\n\n4a. The Spirit here may signify the Divine Spirit, which is really the force through which the regeneration of humanity is brought about, or it may mean Divine inspiration. The descent of the angels and the Spirit also shows that lailat al-Qadr, as hinted at in the last note, has a deeper significance, for though a particular night in the month of Ramaḍānmay be characterized by great Divine blessings, it is more especially in connection with the mission of one appointed by Allāh for the regeneration of the world that “the angels and the Spirit” come down from heaven, turning men’s minds to the spiritual values of life.\n\n5a. “Peace” is the distinctive mark of lailat al-Qadr. This peace comes to the hearts of the true devotees in the form of a tranquillity of mind which makes them fit to receive Divine blessings. But it is also through one commissioned by God that the basis of peace among men is laid."
