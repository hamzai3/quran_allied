      "note": "4a. Taken metaphorically the first four verses tell us how a great spiritual risingwould be brought about. The cleaving asunder of the heaven would mean that the doorsof heaven will open and Divine help will come to the Prophet. The dispersing of the starssignifies the spreading abroad of the bearers of the message of Truth, who are likened tostars, as the Prophet said: “My companions are as stars” (Msh. 27:13). The indication isthat a time would come when the teachers of Truth would disperse themselves in Arabia,and then throughout the world. The flowing forth of the rivers is in accordance with whatis stated elsewhere in the Holy Qur’ån in a parable: “He sends down water from theclouds, then watercourses flow according to their measure, ... Thus does Allåh set forthparables” (13:17). The rivers of Divine knowledge were made to reach the dry landswithin and without Arabia. The laying open of the graves signifies the spiritual resurrection which was to be brought about by the Holy Prophet, for the reprobate are clearly spoken of as being in the graves (35:22). Thus all these four verses speak of the great changethat was to be brought about in the world by the preaching of the Prophet. According toFarrå, the significance of the laying open of graves is their throwing out gold and silver(mineral wealth), which lies buried in them, and the coming out of the dead will be afterthis, and it is one of the signs of the Hour that the earth should throw out its mineralwealth (LA). Or, what is meant is that the mysteries hidden from the human eye will berevealed (R). Taken literally, the words speak of the Resurrection.\n\n5a. This verse supports what is said in the previous note. Qaffål holds that theknowledge spoken of here will accrue before the day of Resurrection (Rz). A greatermanifestation of the same will, however, take place in the life after death.\n\n12a. That every action of man is recorded and bears fruit is one of the principal doctrines of the religion of Islåm. Of course, it is not meant that angels are sitting with pensin their hands and inkstands before them, at desks, like copyists, noting down that at suchand such a time such a one did such a good or such a bad deed. That would be a distortion of the teaching of the Qur’ån. For what that record is, see the next chapter, whereboth the record of the righteous and the record of the wicked is spoken of. Seealso 17:13, 14."
