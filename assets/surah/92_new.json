      "note": "4a. Evil is here compared with the darkness of the night and good with the light ofday. The creation of the male and the female, which stands for the creation of the wholeof animate nature, because all living beings are created either male or female, is also awitness to the same truth, for there we find everyone striving for an end, and everyonereaping according to the manner of his striving.\n\n11a. The two examples given in these verses represent those who accept and thosewho reject the Truth, respectively; the one goes on doing good deeds, finding his wayquite easy, until he finds himself in ease, and the other goes on doing evil, the doing ofwhich seems easy to him, until he finds himself in distress.\n\n13a. The wicked one is here told that he will find himself in distress not only in theHereafter but also in this life, as God has control of both. Or the åkhirah here is what iscoming later — what is promised — and the ∂lå the present state.\n\n20a. The pleasure of the Lord is the only boon for which a man should hope, andhence this is the goal of a Muslim’s life — his paradise in this as well as the next life.This is in accordance with what is said in 9:72, one of the latest revelations: “And greatest of all is Allåh’s goodly pleasure. That is the grand achievement”."
