	  "note": "2a. Takāthur (from kat̲h̲ura, it became abundant or multiplied) means contending together for superiority in (the amount or number of ) property or children or men (LL).According to Rz, the measure of tafā‘ul stands sometimes for the fi‘l itself, and takāt̲h̲urthus may mean increase or abundance of wealth, etc. Coming to the graves stands for death. The significance therefore is that vying one with another in increase of wealth diverts a man from the real object of life until he meets death.\n\n5a. When a man dies, he then comes to know that the acquisition of wealth was in no way the real object of his life. But if he had proceeded on the basis of certain knowledge, he could have seen this in this very life.\n\n8a. Verses 5–8 are considered as disclosing three degrees of certainty — ‘ilm alyaqīn, ‘ain al-yaqīn and √aqq al-yaqīn, i.e., certainty by inference, certainty by sight and certainty by realization. A man can by inference attain to a certainty of the existence of hell in this very life (vv. 5 and 6); after his death he will see hell with his own eyes (v. 7);but a perfect manifestation of it will be realized by him on the day of Resurrection (v. 8).Being questioned about the boons implies tasting of the punishment for failing to make right use of what was granted to man. But the words may also be taken as applying to this life. By pondering on the very nature of evil a man can become certain of hell, this being the certainty by inference. Then he can acquire a certain knowledge by sight, by seeing the fate of others. Lastly, he is made to realize it by disasters being brought upon himself."
