      "note": "3a. The commentators narrate varying reports to the effect that the verse wasrevealed on the occasion of a long pause in the coming of revelation to the HolyProphet. According to Bukhårß, it was only a pause of two or three days (B. 65:93, 2).That revelation was sent down to the Holy Prophet at intervals is a fact, and a pause oftwo or three days could not have given rise to such allegations. The words may be takenas words of solace in general sense, the significance being that God would never forsakehim. But in the light of what follows, the words are prophetical, the indication being thatin its later history Islåm would have to face set-backs which might give rise to suchdoubts. The Prophet and his followers are therefore given an assurance that God willnever forsake the cause of Islåm. Force is lent to this interpretation by the fact that hereit is not the night that is followed by the brightness of the day, which was the case at theappearance of the Prophet, but the brightness of the day is followed by the stillness ofthe night, which seems to be a reference to the inactivity of the Muslim people after thesun had shone, i.e., after the Prophet had made his appearance. The next verse makes itclearer.\n\n5a. Ibn ‘AΔiyyah and others commenting on v. 4 say that by åkhirah is here meantthe latter state of the Prophet’s cause and by the ∂lå, the beginning of it (RM). The lexicologists also explain the word åkhir as the last, hindmost, or what is after the first orformer. And åkhira marratain is explained as meaning the latter of the two times (LL).The words may therefore mean that as time passes, the Prophet’s cause would go ongaining strength, and the latter state would always be better for him than the former.Such indeed is Truth that, although it may gain ground inch by inch after severe strugglewith falsehood, it does continue to advance. Or, the reference here is to the second risingof Islåm, nash‘at thåniyah, after what is called the stillness of the night in the 2nd verse,a long pause of inactivity of the Muslims. References to a set-back to the cause of Islåmfor a long period are very frequent in the Holy Qur’ån; see 32:5a. As a matter of fact, itis true that notwithstanding various set-backs at different periods of its history, the causeof Islåm has gone on gaining ground. When the existing Muslim civilization wasdestroyed by the Mongols, a greater Muslim nation rose up by their joining the ranks ofIslåm; and when Islåm was extirpated in Spain in the West, it gained ground in the FarEast in Indonesia, winning over fifty million people. There is clear and repeated mentionof its final triumph in the whole world, 9:33; 48:28; and 61:9; see 9:33a. Perhaps it is tothis that v. 5 refers — thy Lord will give thee so that thou wilt be well pleased.\n\n6a. ‘Abd Allåh, the Holy Prophet’s father, died about three months before theProphet was born; his mother, Åminah, died when he was six years old. His grandfather,‘Abd al-MuΔΔalib, who took care of him after his mother, died two years later, and fromthat time he remained in charge of Ab∂ Ôålib, his uncle, who was alive when the HolyProphet received the Divine message for the regeneration of mankind.\n\n7a. That erring is not the significance of ˙åll (“groping”) here is shown conclusively by 53:2, which says: “Your companion errs not”. Vv. 6, 7, 8 stand in close relationrespectively to vv. 9, 10 and 11; v. 6 tells the Prophet that he was himself an orphan, andthe conclusion that he should therefore not oppress the orphan is drawn in v. 9; similarly, v. 8 speaks of the Divine favour to him in making him free from want, and the conclusion is drawn in v. 11 that he should therefore proclaim the Divine favour to him.Thus it is clear that v. 6 stands in close relation to v. 9; and v. 8 to v. 11, and the conclusion is evident that v. 7 stands in close relation to v. 10. Now, v. 10 plainly speaks ofone who asks to be guided to the Truth, or a petitioner generally who needs the help ofanother, being unable himself to do a thing or undertake a task; see 10a. The HolyProphet was no doubt a så’il (one who asks) in this sense. He did not worship idols, butneither could he, without the help of Allåh, find out the way for the regeneration of hispeople, for which his soul yearned so eagerly. Hence he was unable to see the way byhimself, and the word ˙åll signifies one who is perplexed and unable to see the way forhimself, from ˙alla, he was perplexed and unable to see his right course (LL). The truesignificance of the word is thus that Allåh found the Prophet in quest of the way, butunable to find the way himself. Therefore He guided him by Divine light. In this mannerwas the Prophet told not to chide any petitioner, but to render help to him as Allåh hadhelped him. Or ˙åll signifies one who becomes lost (T, LL) in the pursuit of someobject, as Jacob’s sons speak of their father as being in ˙alål (R), i.e., lost in the love ofJoseph (12:95), and thus the meaning may be that the Holy Prophet had so devoted himself to the quest of the right way for the world that he had lost himself in that quest; seeintroductory note, chapter 94.\n\n8a. Finding the Holy Prophet in want, and enriching him, do not refer to his temporal or pecuniary circumstances only, if they refer to them at all, but rather to his spiritualneeds and the spiritual wealth with which he was enriched.\n\n9a. Not taking care of the orphans is really their oppression. In one of the many ofhis sayings the Prophet says: He who takes care of the orphan and I are like these two(showing his two fingers close to each other) (B. 70:24).\n\n10a. The word så’il occurring in this verse is interpreted generally as meaning abeggar. But petitioner, or one who asks, is a much better rendering, for it retains thebreadth of the original. Ïasan interpreted the word as meaning he who asks aboutknowledge, and this interpretation is corroborated by what is related in the opening verses of ch. 80. It is, moreover, in consonance with the chief object of a prophet’s mission,which aims at spreading true knowledge.\n\n11a. The ni‘mat, or the favour, is no other than revelation, the greatest of all Divinefavours, as it is recognized to be throughout the Holy Qur’ån. This was the favour whichthe Holy Prophet continued to announce throughout his life. Mujåhid says: The favourreferred to here is the Qur’ån (Rz). "
