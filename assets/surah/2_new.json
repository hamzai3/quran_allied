      "note": "1a. The original words are alif, låm, mßm. Translations of the Holy Qur’ån generally  leave abbreviations, like the one occurring here, untranslated. The combinations of letters or single letters occurring at the commencement of several chapters,      29 in all, are  called muqaΔΔa‘åt, and according to the best received opinion these letters are abbrevi -  ations standing for words. The Arabs used similar letters in their verses. Abbreviations  are known to all languages, the only peculiarity of their use in Arabic literature being  that the letters carry different meanings in different places, and the meaning is decided  in each case by the context. Such is the opinion of I‘Ab (AH). Both he and IMsd agree  in interpreting alif, låm, mßm, occuring here as well as at the commencement of the 3rd,      29th,      30th,      31st and 32nd chapters of the Holy Qur’ån as meaning I, Allåh, am the best  Knower, alif standing for ana, låm for Allåh, and mßm for a‘lam (AH, IJ), being respectively the first, the middle and the last letters of the words for which they stand. Others  regard them as contractions for some Divine attribute. That they may also serve as the  names of chapters is no ground for supposing that they carry no significance. The  strange suggestion of Golius that alif, låm, mßm stands for amr-li-Mu√ammad, which is  said to mean at the command of Mu√ammad, is not only devoid of authority but is also  grammatically incorrect. Rodwell’s statement, made in his comment, on the significance  of the letter n∂n, occurring in the beginning of chapter 68, that “the meaning of this, and  of the similar symbols throughout the Qur’ån, was unknown to the Muhammadans  themselves even in the first century”, is equally devoid of truth. The significance of  these letters can in most cases be traced to the Companions of the Holy Prophet, and  hence the suggestion that these were “private marks” or initial letters attached by their  proprietor to the copies furnished to Zaid, when effecting his recension of the text under  ‘Uthmån, is not even worthy of consideration. It is further opposed to the surest historical testimony, which proves beyond all doubt that these letters were recited as parts of  the chapters in the time of the Prophet himself.\n\n2a. Palmer translates the word dhålika as that, and thinks that its rendering as this is  an error, but as LL says: “Like as a person held in mean estimation is indicated by  hådhå which denotes a thing that is near, so, on account of its high degree of estimation  a thing that is approved is indicated by dhålika, whereby one indicates a thing that is  remote.” \n\n2b. The Qur’ån is here called al-Kitåb, or the Book. The root word kataba means he  wrote and also he brought together (LL) and kitåb, or book, is a writing which is  complete in itself. Thus a letter may also be called a kitåb, and in this sense the word  occurs in 27: 28, 29. The application of the word kitåb to the Holy Qur’ån occurs in very  early revelations, and the use of the word shows clearly that the Qur’ån was from the  first meant to be a complete book and one that existed not only in the memory of men  but also in visible characters on writing material, for otherwise it could not be called  al-Kitåb.\n\n2c, see next page. \n\n2c. I make a departure here from the rendering of the word muttaqß, which English  translators generally render into God-fearing or pious. The root is waqå, and conveys  the sense of saving, guarding, or preserving (LL). According to R, wiqåyah signifies the  guarding of a thing from that which harms or injures it. The verb of which muttaqß is the  nominative form is ittaqå, which means, he preserved or guarded himself exceedingly.  “In the conventional language of the law”, according to LL, “he preserved or guarded  himself exceedingly from sin or what would harm him in the world to come.” Hence the  word muttaqß may properly be translated only as one who guards himself against evil, or  one who is careful of, or has regard for, or keeps his duty. The Qur’ån is here described  as affording guidance to those who keep their duty, because the sense of keeping his  duty is innate in man, and everyone who has regard for duty is true to nature and true to  himself. No guidance would benefit a man who has no regard for his duty. Adopting the  alternative meaning, those who guard against evil, the significance is that guarding  against evil or being saved from sin is the first stage in man’s spiritual advancement, and  the Qur’ån lays down the principles by following which the higher stages of that  advancement are attained.\n\n3a. Al-ghaib is that which is unseen or unperceivable by the ordinary senses.  According to R, the Unseen here stands for Allåh, a belief in Whose existence is the  cardinal principle of religion. A belief in God is thus the first duty of man, the first  requisite of spiritual advancement.\n\n3b. ˝alåt means supplication or prayer. In Islåm prayer assumed a regularity and a  form, and became an established institution of religion. The verb used to indicate the  observance of ©alåt is throughout the Holy Qur’ån aqåma, meaning he kept a thing or an  affair in the right state (LL), and hence it is not the mere observance of the form that the  Qur’ån requires, but the keeping of it in a right state, i.e. being true to the spirit of the  prayer. The object of prayer is elsewhere clearly stated to be the purification of the heart  (29: 45). Spending out of what one has been given stands for charity in its broadest  sense, or the doing of good to all creatures. This verse lays down the two prime duties of  man, the two principles of action which are necessary for spiritual advancement, and  these are prayer to God and service to humanity. After speaking of the cardinal principle  of faith, a belief in God, the Holy Qur’ån now speaks of the two great principles of  action to show how to translate faith into action.\n\n4a. Of all the religions of the world Islåm is the only one that laid down the broad  basis of faith in all the prophets of the world, and the recognition of truth in all religions  is its distinctive characteristic. The words that which was revealed before thee include  revelations to all the nations of the world, for we are elsewhere told that “there is not a  people but a warner has gone among them” (35: 24). The Qur’ån does not, however,  mention all the prophets by their names, for “of them are those We have mentioned  to thee and of them are those We have not mentioned to thee” (40: 78). It thus  requires not only a belief in Divine revelation to the Prophet Muƒammad buta belief in Divine revelation to the whole of humanity, to all nations of the world. A  Muslim is therefore one who believes in all the prophets of God, sent to any nation,  whether their names are mentioned in the Holy Qur’ån or not. This is the fourth of the  fundamental principles of Islåm, the second among matters relating to faith. It shows  that God has always been made known to man through Divine revelation, and that  revelation is a universal fact.\n\n4b. A belief in a life after death is the last of the five fundamental principles of  Islåm that are stated here, the third of the principles of faith. It is only this belief that can  make the generality of men conscious of the responsibility of human actions. A life after  death, according to Islåm, implies a state of existence which begins with death, but a  complete manifestation of which takes place later, when the fruits of the actions done in  this life take their final shape. It should be borne in mind that a belief in Allåh and a  belief in the Hereafter, being respectively the first and the last of the fundamental  principles of Islåm as mentioned here, often stand for a belief in all the fundamental  principles of Islåm, as in vv. 8,      62, etc. It is quite unwarranted to take al-Åkhirat as  meaning the message or revelation which is to come. The Qur’ån knows of no message  coming to humanity after it. It is the last message, religion having been made perfect by  it (5: 3). The Åkhirat of this verse is plainly spoken of as the Last Day in v. 8.\n\n5a. Those who accept the three principles of faith, and the two principles of action,  mentioned above, are declared to be successful. The word mufliƒ is the nominative form  of afla√a which means he attained to success, and includes both the good of this life and  the good of the Hereafter (T). The next two verses speak of those who disbelieve.\n\n6a. The passage is parenthetical (AH), and should be translated as such. The  ordinary rendering of the passage, which makes the parenthetical passage an enunciative  one, makes the verse meaningless, for it would then run thus: “Those who disbelieve it  is alike to them whether thou warn them or warn them not; they will not believe.” Now  this amounts to saying that no one who once disbelieves would ever believe, a statement  which is absurd on the face of it. Treating the portion quoted above as parenthetical, the  meaning is quite clear, viz., disbelievers of a particular type, i.e., those who pay no heed  at all to the Prophet’s warning, cannot benefit by his preaching.\n\n7a. It should be noted that only those disbelievers are spoken of here who so  hardened their hearts as not to pay any heed to the Prophet’s preaching and warning, as  clearly indicated in the previous verse; compare 7: 179: “They have hearts wherewith they  understand not, and they have eyes wherewith they see not, and they have ears wherewith  they hear not. They are as cattle.” Allåh is here spoken of as having sealed their hearts  and ears because He made them taste the consequences of their heedlessness.\n\n8a. Belief in Allåh and the Last Day is here equivalent to the profession of Islåm;  see 4b. After speaking of the two classes, the accepters and the rejecters of the Prophet’s  message, the Holy Qur’ån now speaks of a third class, the insincere people who accept  the message only with their lips. The persons spoken of in this verse are the hypocrites,  who were a source of constant trouble to the Prophet at Madßnah. Before he came to that  city, ‘Abd Allåh ibn Ubayy was a person of note there, and he expected to become the  leader. But the Prophet’s advent and his recognition by all the communities of that city,  as head of the state, robbed him of those dearly cherished hopes, and he along with his  followers adopted an attitude of hypocrisy. The case of the hypocrites is dealt with at  length here, in 3: 149–181; 4: 60 –152; 9: 38–127, and in the 63rd chapter, and occasionally elsewhere. But apart from the particular class of people spoken of here who were  really enemies of Islåm in the guise of believers, there are in every religion large  numbers of people whose hearts are affected with a similar spiritual disease. Their  acceptance of the Truth is only with the lips, and faith does not go deep down into their  hearts. They are loud in their claims but when there is a question of carrying out the  precepts of the faith or of making any sacrifice in its cause, they lag behind. These  verses may as well apply to them.\n\n9a. Khåda‘a signifies he strove, endeavoured or desired to deceive him. One says  this of a man when he has not attained his desire (LL). Khåda‘a also indicates, when  used concerning the Divine Being, He requited to him his deceit (T, LL); see 15a and  4: 142a. Khåda‘a also means he forsook, he refrained (LL).\n\n10a. Compare 71: 6, where Noah is made to say: “But my call has only made them  flee the more”, though the call was meant to bring them nearer to the truth. The disease  here stands for the weakness of their hearts (AH), for they had not the courage to deny  Islåm openly, and this weakness only became the greater as the cause of Islåm became  more and more triumphant.\n\n12a. Their idea of making peace was only this, that they mixed with both parties,  but they were really taking advantage of this opportunity to sow the seeds of dissension  and mischief among the various parties. In fact, they were a constant source of mischief  for whereas outwardly they were with the Muslims, they always plotted against them  and gave help to their enemies.\n\n13a. They called the Muslims fools because they were undergoing all kinds of  sufferings and making sacrifices for the sake of the Truth. The hypocrites were under the  impression that the Muslims would soon be wiped out of existence. They are told that  Truth will prosper and the half-hearted ones are really the fools.\n\n14a. By their devils are meant their evil companions, as plainly stated in v. 76:  “And when they meet those who believe, they say, We believe; and when they are apart  one with another they say…” IMsd says that by their devils are meant their leaders in  unbelief (IJ). Kf and Bd say that by their devils are meant those men who made themselves like the devils in their insolence and rebellion. In fact, the word shaiΔån (devil)  signifies “every insolent or rebellious one from among the jinn and the men and the  beasts” (R).\n\n15a. According to LA, the more preferable explanation of the words Allåhu  yastahzi’u bi-him is that Allåh will requite them with punishment according to their  mockery and thus, it is added, the punishment of an evil is spoken of in the terms of an  evil, as is laid down elsewhere: “And the recompense of evil is punishment (or evil) like  it” (42: 40). Another explanation is that given by Kf: “The meaning is the sending down  of disgrace and contempt, for the object which a mocker has in view is to hold him whom  he mocks in light estimation and to bring down contempt and disgrace upon him.”\n\n16a. They rejected the Truth and followed the error, thinking that this course  would bring them worldly gain. They are told that they will have neither worldly gain  nor guidance, and will be losers both temporally and spiritually.\n\n17a. The kindler of the fire is the Holy Prophet, who kindled the torch of light. The  opening words of a √adßth are: “My example is the example of a man who kindles a  fire...” (B. 81: 26). The personal pronouns used lend weight to this interpretation. The  kindler of the fire and the illuminer is one, while those whose light is taken away are  many. This interpretation of the parable is, moreover, in accordance with the next  parable, where the rain is unanimously agreed upon as representing the Divine Revelation.\n\n17b. The light of their eyes, which alone could make them take advantage of the  light which was lit up by the Prophet, was taken away. The act of taking away the light  is attributed to Allåh, as the remote cause of the disappearance of their sight.\n\n18a. The description seems to apply to those spoken of in v. 6, and accordingly the  first parable may apply to them instead of to the hypocrites; or it may apply to those  hypocrites who persisted in the wrong course and refused to take any advantage of the  light and guidance brought by the Prophet.\n\n19a. Samå’ is literally the higher or the upper, or the highest or the uppermost  part of anything, and it means the sky or the heaven, the clouds or a cloud (T). It is a  collective noun and is used both as singular and plural (LL).\n\n19b. This is a parable showing the condition of the hypocrites and the weak-hearted ones. When difficulties and distresses befell the Muslims — when it became dark —  the hypocrites and the weak-hearted stood still. They refused to keep company with the  Muslims in the battles which the latter had to fight. When there was a flash of lightning,  and a success followed — a success so great that it almost blinded them — they would  walk on a little and seem to be keeping company with the Muslims. The same idea is expressed in 22: 11 in the following words: “And among men is he who serves Allåh,  (standing) on the verge, so that if good befalls him he is satisfied therewith, but if a trial  afflicts him he turns back headlong.” The difficulties and distresses which the Muslims  experienced in the early days of Islåm greatly obstructed its spread and held back many  of the weak-hearted, who, under better circumstances, would have gladly joined its ranks.\n\n22a. The word binå’ signifies a structure (LL) in its widest sense, viz., any production or piece of work consisting of parts joined together in some definite manner. The  heaven is here called a structure in reference to the order which prevails in heavenly  bodies. But binå’ is also used to signify the roof or the ceiling of a house, and as such it is  used figuratively to indicate the vast blue overhead. Attention is thus drawn to the oneness of humanity, as if it were a single family living in one resting-place under one roof.\n\n23a. A similar challenge is contained in 10: 38, and in 11: 13 doubters are challenged  to produce ten chapters like it, while in 17: 88, a very early revelation, the whole of  mankind are declared to be unable to produce a book like the Qur’ån. Is it a question of  mere style and diction? The Qur’ån itself does not say so, nor does any saying of the  Holy Prophet. That the Qur‘ån is a unique production of Arabic literature and has ever  been regarded as the standard of the purity of that literature, goes without saying, but the  chief characteristic of the Holy Book, in which no other book can claim equality with it,  is the wonderful transformation which it accomplished, and it is to this characteristic  that it lays claim in the very commencement when it says that this Book is a guide (2: 2).  That the transformation wrought by it is unparalleled in the history of the world is  admitted on all hands, for if the Holy Prophet was the “most successful of all prophets and religious personalities” (En. Br. 11th ed., Art. Koran), this success was due to no  other cause than the Qur’ån. Its injunctions swept off the most deep-rooted evils, like  idolatry and drunkenness, so as to leave no trace of them in the Arabian peninsula, welded  the warring elements of Arabian society into one nation, and made an ignorant people  the foremost torchbearers of knowledge and science, and a politically down-trodden  people the masters of the greatest empire of the world. Besides, every word of the  Qur’ån gives expression to Divine majesty and glory in a manner which is not  approached by any other sacred book. The challenge remains unanswered to this day.\n\n23b. The word shuhadå’, translated as helpers or leaders, is the plural of shahßd,  meaning one who gives information of what he has witnessed, or one who knows and  declares what he knows, or one possessing much knowledge (LL). Shahßd also means an  imåm or a leader. \n\n24a. The word stones stands for al-√ijårah, the plural of √ajar, meaning stone, so  called because it resists by reason of its hardness; the verb √ajara signifies he prevented,  hindered, forbade, etc. (LL). By stones are here generally understood the idols which  the Arabs worshipped, even unhewn stones being sometimes the objects of worship  among them. But the word √ijårah may bear another significance. According to LA, you  say: “Such an one was assailed with the √ajar of the earth,” when his assailant is a  formidable man. And when Mu‘åwiyah named ‘Amr ibn ‘Å© as one of the two umpires  to decide the quarrel between himself and ‘Alß, A√naf said to ‘Alß: “Thou hast had a  √ajar (exceedingly sagacious and crafty and politic man) made to be an assailant against  thee” (LL). The reference in √ijårah may, therefore, be to the leaders spoken of in the  previous verse, while nås would stand for the common people.\n\n25a. Gardens with rivers flowing in them is the ever-recurring description of a  future life of the righteous that occurs in the Holy Qur’ån. Elsewhere, the pure word of  faith is compared to a tree which gives its fruit in all seasons (14: 24,      25). Belief is thus  like a seed cast into the ground, growing into a tree and bearing fruit when properly nurtured. The rivers represent the good deeds which are necessary to the growth of the seed.  It should be borne in mind that the description of paradise as given in the Holy Qur’ån is  expressly stated to be a parable: “A parable of the Garden which is promised to those  who keep their duty” (13: 35; 47: 15). The righteous are spoken of as having gardens in  the next life to show that they have made the seed of faith to grow into extensive  gardens, and this is in reference to the vast development of their inner self or of the  faculties which God has given them.\n\n25b. Rizq (lit., sustenance) also signifies √a˚˚ or a portion (LL). The fruits of the  life after death are the consequences of the deeds done in this life.\n\n25c. The meaning seems to be that whenever the faithful are made to taste of a  portion of the fruits of their good deeds in the life to come, they will find those fruits so  much resembling the fruits which they tasted spiritually in this life that they will think  that the same fruits are given to them again. Or the words may signify: This is what was  promised to us before. The like of it may signify that the fruits of their deeds will be  similar to those deeds.\n\n25d. The pure mates or companions may be the believing wives of the faithful, as  elsewhere we have: “They and their wives are in shades, reclining on raised couches”  (36: 56). But more probably these are among the blessings of the heavenly life to which  men and women are equally entitled. The true nature of these blessings is pointed out  elsewhere under the word ƒ∂r in 52: 20a, but it may be remarked here that all the  blessings of heavenly life are according to a saying of the Holy Prophet “things which  no eye has seen and no ear has heard, nor has it entered into the heart of man to  conceive of them” (B. 59: 8). The words in which these blessings are depicted in the  Holy Qur’ån, therefore, should not be taken literally.\n\n26a. The parables to which reference is contained in these words are the parables  speaking of the weakness of the false deities; see 29: 41: “The parable of those who take  guardians besides Allåh is as the parable of the spider that makes for itself a house, and  surely the frailest of the houses is the spider’s house”; and 22: 73: “O people, a parable is  set forth, so listen to it. Surely those whom you call upon besides Allåh cannot create a  fly though they should all gather for it. And if the fly carry off aught from them, they  cannot take it back from it. Weak are (both) the invoker and the invoked.”  Instead of the spider and the fly, however, the gnat is mentioned here because the  ba‘∂˙ah, or the gnat, is among the Arabs a proverbially weak creature, so that to express  the utmost degree of weakness they say, weaker than the gnat.\n\n26b. According to R, i˙lål (ordinarily translated as leading astray) has a two-fold  significance. It means leading one astray as well as finding one as erring; a˙laltu ba‘ßrß  means I found that my camel had gone astray. Another significance of the word a˙alla is  he adjudged or pronounced him to have gone astray, as a˙alla-nß ©adßqß, occurring in a  verse, is explained as meaning my friend pronounced me to be in error (LL). It is said of  the Prophet in a ƒadßth that he came to a people fa-a˙alla-hum, which does not mean that  he led them astray but that he found them to have gone astray (N). The same authority  quotes other instances of a similar use of the measure if‘ål, as aƒmadtu-h∂ means, not I  praised him but, I found him praiseworthy, and abkhaltu-h∂ means I found him parsimonious or avaricious. It is a plain fact that Allåh guides people or shows them the right  way by sending His messengers, and therefore He could not be spoken of as leading them\n\nastray. And the objects of i˙lål are always the transgressors as here, or the wrong-doers  as in 14: 27, or the prodigal as in 40:34. And again it is the devil that leads astray as in  28: 15, or the transgressors as in 6: 119, etc. Hence, when ascribed to God, the word a˙alla  means He pronounced him to be erring or He left him in error.\n\n27a. The covenant of Allåh referred to here is the evidence of His Unity to which  human nature bears witness, as referred to in the next verse, and as stated in 7:172. The  confirmation of this covenant is brought about by sending prophets. Cutting off what  Allåh has ordered to be joined is the disregard of others’ rights.\n\n28a. The first part of the verse contains an argument of the existence of God Who  gave life to man, and the second states that death on this earth is not the end of life but  the beginning of another, an eternal and a far higher life.\n\n29a. Thumma generally denotes then or afterwards, and it is a particle denoting  order and delay, but there are many examples of its use in which it implies neither order  nor delay. According to Akh and other authorities, thumma has often the meaning of wåw,  i.e., and (LL). For the statement that the earth was made after the heavens, see 79:30.\n\n29b. It is impossible to deal with the subject of the Quranic cosmogony within the  limits of a footnote. But a few suggestions may be made here. In the first place, it  should be noted that the word sab’a, which signifies the number seven, is also used in a  vague manner, as meaning seven, or more, several or many (LL). According to LA, the  Arabic equivalents of the numbers seven, seventy, and seven hundred are all used to  indicate a large number by the Arabs: “The mention of seven and seventy and seven hundred is frequent in the Qur’ån and the sayings of the Holy Prophet, and the Arabs used  them to signify a large number and multiplicity”. Similarly Az explains the word  sab‘ßna, meaning seventy, as occurring in 9: 80, as being “used to signify a large number  and multiplicity, not indicating exactness in number” (LA). Hence the seven heavens  may signify a large number of heavens. Secondly, the significance of the word samå’,  which means only what we see above us, should not be lost sight of. R makes the meaning very clear when he says: “Every samå’, i.e. heaven, is a heaven in relation to what is  beneath it and an earth in relation to what is above it”. Thirdly, in 65: 12 it is affirmed  that as there are seven heavens so there is a like number of earths, which corroborates the conclusion drawn above. Fourthly, the seven heavens are on one occasion called the  seven ways (23: 17), and in this sense the orbit of a planet may be called its heaven. In  fact, this interpretation makes the significance of 65: 12 very clear, for each of the seven  earths will thus have a heaven for it. The seven earths together with our earth would thus  make up the eight major primary planets of the solar system. Or, the seven heavens may  be taken to apply to the whole starry creation, and the reference may in this case be to  the seven magnitudes of the stars which may be seen by the naked eye.  One point more may be noted here. The samå’ or the heaven is plainly called  dukhån, i.e. smoke or vapour, in 41:11.\n\n30a. The Arabic word for angels is malå’ikah, which is the plural of malak. It is said  to be derived, either from malaka which means he controlled, and refers to the angels’  function of controlling the forces of nature on the physical side of life, or from alk, to send,  the original being in this case ma’lak, contracted into malak, and refers to the angels’ spiritual function of acting as intermediaries between God and man. Both root ideas thus contain a reference to the principal functions ascribed to the angels. The existence of such  intermediaries has been recognized by righteous men in all ages and all countries.  It will also be seen, from what has been said above as to the functions of the angelic  beings, that Allåh’s saying to them is really the expression of an intention which is to be  brought into execution. It is not a conversation, or a consultation with the angels; it is an  expression of the Divine will to those intermediary beings who are entrusted by the Divine  Being with the execution of it. It may also be added that by the angels here are meant the  angels entrusted with this particular affair, not all the angels of the universe (IJ).\n\n30b. This shows the high place that man was destined to hold in the whole of creation. The original word khalßfah (from khalafa, meaning he came after or succeeded  another that had perished or died), means primarily a successor, and hence the supreme  or the greatest ruler who supplies the place of him who has been before him (T, LL).  IMsd and I‘Ab explain khalßfah as meaning one who judges among, or rules, the creatures of Allåh by His command (IJ). What is stated here is an allegorical description of the  preference of man above the whole of the creation on this earth, and then of the election  of those righteous servants of Allåh from among men themselves who lead others into the  right path. One of the significances suggested by the commentators is that the word khalßfah here refers to the children of Adam, i.e., the whole of mankind. The correctness of this  view is corroborated by the Qur’ån itself, which says, referring to the whole of mankind:  “and He it is Who has made you successors in the land (or rulers in the earth)” (6: 165),  the word used for rulers being khalå’if, plural of khalßfah. Hence the reference here  seems to be to the whole of mankind. References to Adam are contained in 2: 30–39 and  in 3: 59; 7: 11–25; 15: 28– 44; 17: 61–65; 18: 50; 20: 115–124 and 38: 71–85.\n\n30c. God declares His will to the angels, the controlling forces of nature, to create  man who is meant to rule the forces of nature, and to whom, therefore, power to rule is  to be delegated. Being entrusted with such great powers, man could use them rightly or  wrongly, and it is to this fear of abuse of power that the angels give expression, they  themselves being only executors of Divine will in which they have no choice. The concluding words of this verse show that God knew that man would abuse the power given  to him, but He also knew that he would turn it to good use as well. The whole history of man is briefly written in this one verse. Man is the greatest killer on this earth but he  also turns the gifts of God to the best use. The angels speak of the darker side of the picture of humanity, but to God was known the brighter side as well as the darker side of  this picture. Hence the words, I know what you know not. \n\n30d. While giving expression to the darker side of the picture of humanity, these  intermediaries declare that this could not be the Divine purpose, for God is free from all  imperfections, such being the significance of tasbß√ (LL), generally rendered as declaring the glory of God. \n\n31a. Adam is generally taken to be the proper name for the first man, but neither  here nor anywhere else in the Holy Qur’ån is it affirmed that Adam was the first man or  that there was no creation before him. On the other hand, great Muslim theologians have  held that there were many Adams — thousands of Adams — before the great ancestor of  mankind known by this name (RM). As the previous verse shows, the whole of humanity is spoken of here because the shedding of blood could not be the work of one man;  the reference is to the shedding of the blood of man by man. Adam, therefore, though it  may also be the name of a particular man, stands for man generally.\n\n31b. Explaining asmå’, which literally signifies names (being plural of ism, meaning  a name), Rz says: “He taught him the attributes of things and their descriptions and their  characteristics, for the attributes of a thing are indicative of its nature”. Teaching Adam the  names therefore signifies the vast capability of man and the superiority of his knowledge  to that of the angels. Or, the reference may be to the faculty of speech, which is the real  source of the excellence of man above the whole of creation. To this the Holy Qur’ån  refers elsewhere too: “He created man, taught him (the mode of) expression” (55: 3,      4).\n\n31c. Man’s superiority to the angels is made clear here. The angels were not gifted  with the knowledge which was given to man, and the gift of knowledge was the greatest  gift of God. The form of dialogue is kept up to indicate eternal truths. Man might be a  maker of mischief and a shedder of blood, but he possessed vast capability for knowledge,  and hence the angels’ estimate of man, which looked only to the darker side of the picture,  was not a right estimate. Evil there might be in him, but the good was preponderant.  Note that ©idq (lit., truth) sometimes signifies ©awåb, or that which is right, as kidhb  (lit., falsehood) sometimes signifies khaΔa’, i.e., that which is wrong (Rz).\n\n33a. “What you hide” refers to those great qualities in man which preponderate the  evil in him, and which remain hidden until they are made manifest through the Divine  gift of knowledge. The immense capability of man for progress remains hidden, while  the evil of shedding blood is manifested in a very primary stage in his growth.\n\n34a. Sajada is really synonymous with kha˙‘a, i.e., he was lowly or submissive (LL).  In the Holy Qur’ån, the word is frequently used to signify simple submission. And you  also say, sajada la-h∂, meaning he saluted him or he paid respect or honour to him (LL).  What is the significance of the angels being submissive to Adam? In the first place,  it must be remembered that Adam throughout this section stands for man generally; so  submission is not limited to one particular man; it is to man generally. Secondly, it has  already been shown that man has a superiority over the angels on account of his great  gift of knowledge of things, the angels being the controlling powers of the forces of  nature. By his knowledge man could harness the forces of nature and exercise control  over them; in other words, the angels submitted to him.\n\n34b. Iblßs was not one of the angels: “He was of the jinn, so he transgressed”  (18: 50). In v. 36 he is called Satan. It should be borne in mind that Iblßs and Satan (Ar.  shaiΔån) refer to one and the same being. The word Iblßs is used when the Evil one’s evil  is limited to himself, and Satan, when his evil affects others besides himself; or Iblßs is  the proud one, and Satan the deceiver. Iblßs is derived from balasa, meaning he  despaired, and ShaiΔån from shaΔana, meaning he became distant or remote. The same  entity is thus mentioned under two different names; he is called Iblßs because he despairs  of the mercy of God and ShaiΔån because he allures others to do things which remove  them further off from Divine mercy. Iblßs therefore stands for the lower desires which  keep man off from bowing before God and seeking His mercy, and Satan incites the low  desires of man to lead others away from the path of rectitude.  What is the significance underlying the refusal of Iblßs to submit to man? As shown  in the last footnote, the angels’ submission meant that man could control the forces of  nature by his knowledge of things; he could conquer nature. But he himself was a part of  nature, and he could not conquer his own evil desires. His advancement lay in two directions, the conquest of nature and the conquest of his own self. He could attain the first  end by the power of knowledge with which he was gifted, but the higher end, the conquest of self, needed yet another act of Divine mercy, the sending of Divine Revelation;  and this is explained in this story of Adam in v. 38.\n\n34c. The thing excepted by means of illå (lit., except) is in some cases disunited in  kind from that from which the exception is made, and the statement which follows illå  is, therefore, a new statement altogether cut off from the first. Therefore instead of  adopting the ordinary rendering, with the exception of Iblßs, I adopt but Iblßs did not.\n\n34d. Note that he refused to submit because he was a disbeliever, which further  corroborates the statement that he was not one of the angels.\n\n35a. The garden spoken of in this verse was on this earth, as it was on the earth  that man was placed. It was certainly not the paradise to which men go after death, and  from which they will never be expelled (15: 48). The placing in the garden signifies  leading a life of ease and comfort, as is shown by the words that follow: “Eat from it a  plenteous food wherever you wish”. And more clearly still, the life in the garden is thus  described in 20: 117–119: “So let him not drive you both out of the garden so that thou  art unhappy. Surely it is granted to thee therein that thou art not hungry, nor naked. And  that thou art not thirsty therein, nor exposed to the sun’s heat”. And now, as it were, to  complete the picture of happiness, the woman is brought in, and both Adam and his wife  are made to dwell in the garden, though there is no mention of the wife in what has gone  before. All this shows that life in the garden meant a life of comfort, ease and happiness. \n\n35b. Raghad here either qualifies an understood noun, and the meaning is a  plenteous food, or it is indicative of the condition of Adam and Eve, and the words may  thus be rendered: Eat from it wherever you wish, having abundance of all things.\n\n35c. According to the Bible, the tree which Adam was forbidden to approach was  the tree of knowledge of good and evil; the Qur’ån does not say so. On the other hand,  where the devil deceives man, he calls it “the tree of immortality” (20: 120). It was therefore just the opposite of what the devil stated it to be. It was the tree of death, the spiritual death of man — the tree of evil. Adam undoubtedly stands for man in the whole of  this description, and it is evil which man is again and again forbidden to approach, and it  is evil against which all prophets of God have warned men. In the Qur’ån, it is always  called this tree, which further shows that it was something which was known to man,  and there is not the least doubt that not only has man been warned against evil throughout his history, but hatred for evil is also innate in him. That man hates evil by nature is  shown by the fact that every man condemns evil when it is done by another. As regards  the figurative use of the word tree, compare 14: 24–26, where a good word is likened to  “a good tree, whose root is firm and whose branches are high, yielding its fruit in every  season”, and an evil word is likened to “an evil tree pulled up from the earth’s surface; it  has no stability”. The order to eat from the earth a plenteous food but not to approach  evil is really a description of what pure human nature is. Man is entitled to all the  benefits of nature to maintain the body, to harness the forces of nature for his  physical comforts and happiness, so long as he does not forget his soul. It is an order not  to pamper the body at the expense of the soul, but it is as yet an order innate in human  nature, not an order given by Divine Revelation — the need for revelation comes on  later.\n\n36a. Azalla (translated as made them slip) is derived from zall, to slip (foot or  tongue) unintentionally (R), and zallat is a fault committed unintentionally (R). Azallahumå therefore means the devil made them commit a fault unintentionally. The result  was that they were made to depart from the happy condition in which they were. The  lesson taught here is that real happiness lies in peace of mind, so that when the peace of  mind is disturbed by committing an evil, even if it be unintentional, physical happiness  does not avail a man.  How did the devil do it? Here the Qur’ån again contradicts the Bible. It was not the  serpent that misled Eve, nor did Eve mislead Adam. The devil cast an evil suggestion  into the minds of both Adam and Eve, as he casts evil suggestions into the mind of every  son and daughter of Adam and Eve: “But the devil made an evil suggestion to them that  he might make manifest to them that which had been hidden from them of their shame”  (7: 20).\n\n36b. HabΔ sometimes means going down a declivity, or descending from a high  place to a low one, but its more frequent use in literature is simply in the sense of  removing from one place to another, as in ihbiΔ∂ mi©r-an (2: 61), which means go to, or  enter into, a city. It also signifies simply change in condition. According to LL, habaΔa  means he came forth from it and also he became lowered or degraded. And habΔ further  signifies falling into evil; or becoming low or abject; or suffering loss or diminution.  This loss or suffering is brought about by means of indulgence in evil.  The new condition in which man finds himself by submitting to his low desires is  the condition of the mutual enmity of one to the other, the tyranny of man to man being  undoubtedly the greatest evil which man can commit. The use of the words “some of  you are the enemies of others” shows clearly that this address is not to Adam and Eve  alone, but to all mankind or man in general.\n\n36c. The words “an abode and a provision for a time” refer to man’s span of life  on earth, which is limited as compared with the eternal life of the next world.\n\n37a. The Arabic word taubah (repentance) gives us in fact the philosophy of repentance. Tåba originally means he returned, and hence the primary meaning of tåba  il-Allåhi is he returned to Allåh. In religious terminology the word taubah comes to mean  the returning to a state of obedience. Thus taubah implies a perfect change in the course  of one’s life, and this is repentance according to the Holy Qur’ån. It is not an utterance of  certain words, but an actual change for the better. The same word tåba is used to express  the Divine act of the acceptance of repentance, with reference again to the original  meaning of the word, because in this case the Divine Being deals with man mercifully.  Kalimåt (words) here means the revealed words of God. Man is found too weak to  overcome the evil suggestions of the devil or the evil inclinations in him, however  strong he may be to conquer the forces of nature. So God comes to his help and reveals  Himself to him. He sends down revelation which, strengthening his faith in God, gives  him the strength to overcome the devil and reject his suggestions.\n\n38a. This section is now closed with the statement of a general law that Divine  Revelation will be granted to the whole of humanity and prophets will appear everywhere from time to time, and that it would be by following the Guidance sent by God  through His prophets that men will attain to perfection. This state of perfection is  described as a state in which “no fear shall come upon them, nor shall they grieve”. The  man who truly follows the Divine Revelation shall have no fear of the devil misleading  him, for he has subjugated his devil, nor shall he grieve that he wasted the opportunity  given him in this life, for he turned it to the best use.  \n\n39a. The word åyat (plural åyåt), which occurs for the first time here, is of very  frequent occurrence in the Holy Qur’ån and conveys a number of significances. The  primary meaning of åyat is an apparent sign or mark (R), by which a thing is known.  Hence it comes to signify a sign as meaning an indication or evidence or proof (T, LL).  In this sense it signifies what is called a mu‘jizah or a miracle, instead of which the Holy  Qur’ån always uses the word åyat, thus showing that the miracles of which it speaks are  not wonders but actual evidence or proof of the truth of a prophet. But the most frequent  use of the word åyat in the Holy Qur’ån is to signify a message or a communication and  it is in this sense that the word is applied to a verse of the Holy Qur’ån, i.e., a collection  of the words of the Holy Qur’ån continued to its breaking, or a portion of the Qur’ån  after which a suspension of the speech is approvable (T, LL). But it generally retains the  wider significance of a sign or a mark, or a Divine message or a Divine communication.\n\n39b. As against those who attain to perfection by following the Divine message, the  people spoken of in this verse are those who not only disbelieve but also exert their utmost  to oppose revealed truth and uproot it. Such people are described as companions of the  Fire. They keep company with evil in this life, so the fire becomes their companion in the  next to purge them of the evil consequences of their evil deeds. Their hearts burn with evil  passions in this life, and it is this very fire that assumes a palpable shape in the next.  Khalada signifies originally he remained or abode, or remained or abode long, being  synonymous with aqåma (A). Hence you say khwålid (plural of khålid), meaning the three  stones upon which the cooking-pot is placed, so called because of their remaining for a long time after the standing relics of a house have become effaced (LL). Therefore  khålid∂n signifies simply abiding, and does not necessarily convey the idea of perpetuity. \n\n40a. After speaking of the need of Divine Revelation, the Qur’ån now speaks of a  nation to whom this favour was granted, among whom many prophets were raised and  who were also made rulers in the earth: “Remember the favour of Allåh to you when He  raised prophets among you and made you kings and gave you what He gave not to any  other of the nations” (5: 20). The Jewish people who are addressed here are generally  mentioned as Children of Israel, Israel being the other name of Jacob, son of Isaac, son  of Abraham.  As for the covenants spoken of here, see Deut. 26: 17–19: “Thou hast avouched the  Lord this day to be thy God, and to walk in His ways, and to keep His statutes, and His  commandments, and His judgments, and to hearken unto His voice. And the Lord hath  avouched thee this day to be His peculiar people, as He hath promised thee, and that thou  shouldst keep all His commandments; and to make thee high above all nations which He  hath made, in praise, and in name, and in honour”. The “hearkening unto the voice of the  Lord” means the acceptance of the revelation to the promised prophet of Deut. 18: 18, as  Deut. 18: 19 shows clearly: “And it shall come to pass that whosoever will not hearken  unto My words which he shall speak in My name, I will require it of him”.\n\n41a. The verification referred to here is clearly the fulfilment of the promise contained in Deut. 18: 15–18: “The Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a prophet from the  midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye shall hearken .... I will raise  them up a prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee, and will put My words in  his mouth; and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him”. It is nowhere but  in the Holy Qur’ån that the “word of God”, as promised here, is “put into the Prophet’s  mouth”, and no prophet ever claimed to have come in fulfilment of this prophecy except  the Holy Prophet Muƒammad. The whole of the Israelite history after Moses is silent as  to the appearance of the promised prophet of Deut. Even Jesus Christ never said that he  came in fulfilment of that prophecy and his apostles truly felt that difficulty when they  thought that that prophecy would be fulfilled in the second coming of Christ. But one of  the earliest messages of the Holy Prophet was that he was the like of the prophet sent to  Pharaoh (73: 15), and the claim is often repeated in the Holy Qur’ån. \n\n41b. The religious leaders are specially addressed in this section. They rejected the  truth which the Prophet brought, fearing to lose their high position as leaders. They thus  sacrificed truth to the inducements of this life, and took “a mean price” for it. \n\n42a. It is again the religious leaders who are spoken of here: “Mixing up the truth  with falsehood” signifies their mixing up the prophecy with their own false interpretations of it, and thus making obscure the prophecy itself, while “hiding the truth” signifies  their concealing the prophecy itself, for they often commanded their followers not to  disclose to the Muslims those prophecies which were known to them. Compare v. 76.  Or, by the truth is meant that which was revealed to their prophets, and by falsehood  their own ideas which they mixed up with Divine Revelation.\n\n43a. These are the two fundamental principles of religion, worship of God through  prayer to Him, and service of humanity or helping the poor. \n\n44a. The leaders enjoined their followers to be good because they could not remain  leaders otherwise, but their own lives were corrupt. They read the Book and yet they did  not follow it; how could the ignorant masses benefit by their preaching?\n\n45a. A sign of the promised prophet of Deut. 18: 18 was that he would utter prophecies which would prove true. “And if thou say in thine heart, How shall we know the word  which the Lord hath not spoken? When a prophet speaketh in the name of the Lord, if the  thing follow not, nor come to pass, that is the thing which the Lord hath not spoken, but  the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously: thou shalt not be afraid of him” (Deut. 18: 21,      22). The Qur’ån had in the Prophet’s utter helplessness at Makkah, and when the Quraish  were day and night planning to take away his very life, uttered forcible predictions of the  final triumph of the Prophet and of the vanquishment and discomfiture of his opponents,  and those prophecies were now being fulfilled. They were, therefore, asked to wait until  the Truth shone out in its full resplendence and to seek Divine help through prayer.\n\n46a. Òann signifies thought, opinion or conjecture, and also knowledge or certainty  which “is obtained by considering with endeavour to understand, not by ocular per -  ception, or not such as relates to an object of sense” (LL).\n\n47a. By “the nations” are meant the people contemporaneous with the Israelites in  their days of triumph, or large masses of people (AH). Numerous prophets were raised  among them, and they were made to rule in the earth, and these are the favours of which  Moses also reminds them (5: 20).\n\n48a. The Jewish religious leaders are specially addressed in the previous section.  The masses who followed them blindly are now told that their leaders will not avail them  aught on the great day of Reckoning when every soul is held responsible for what it did.\n\n48b. Shafå‘at (meaning intercession) is derived from the root shaf‘, which signifies the making a thing to be one of a pair (T, LL) or the adjoining a thing to its like  (R), and hence it comes to signify intercession. The doctrine of shaf å‘at or intercession  is a well-known doctrine, according to which the prophets and the righteous will intercede for the sinners on the day of Judgment. But intercession has another significance  also, which is referred to in 4: 85, viz., the institution of a way which another imitates, so  that the latter, in fact, joins himself to his model, and this is really the primary significance of shaf å‘at. Thus shaf å‘at has a twofold significance, viz., firstly it enables a man  to walk in the ways of righteousness by imitating his model, and, secondly, it affords  him a shelter from the evil consequences of certain weaknesses which he is unable to  overcome by himself.  The statement made here, that intercession shall not be accepted on a certain day, is  in reference to those who have not made themselves deserving of intercession by joining  themselves with a righteous servant of God, so as to take him for their model. It is only  people who have done their best to follow a righteous servant of God and failed in some  respects owing to mortal weaknesses that can benefit by intercession, not those who pay  no regard at all to Divine commandments.\n\n49a. No details of the oppressions to which the Israelites were subjected are given  in the Holy Qur’ån. According to the Bible: “They did set over them taskmasters to  afflict them with their burdens” (Exod. 1: 11); “And they made their lives bitter with  hard bondage, in mortar and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their  service, wherein they made them serve, was with rigour” (Exod. 1: 14).\n\n49b. See Exod. 1: 15–18 and also 1: 22: “And Pharaoh charged all his people,  saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall  save alive”. The object was to demoralize and extirpate the Israelites. \n\n50a. The Qur’ån does not say how the Israelites were made to pass through the sea  or in what manner the parting of the sea was brought about. The word ba√r means a sea  or a river. As the Bible says, it was the northern extremity of the Red sea; “the Lord  caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night” (Exod. 14: 21), thus  enabling the Israelites to get through. Another explanation is that the Israelites passed  when the sea receded on account of the ebb, and the Egyptians were drowned because  the tide was on at the time, and in their zeal to overtake the Israelites they did not care  for it. Elsewhere the Qur’ån says: “And certainly We revealed to Moses: Travel by night  with My servants, then strike for them a dry path in the sea” (20: 77). See also 20: 77a. \n\n51a. “And Moses went into the midst of the cloud, and got him up into the Mount:  and Moses was in the Mount forty days and forty nights” (Exod. 24: 18). \n\n51b. Details are contained in 20: 86–97. The story of the making of the calf is  contained in the Bible in the 32nd chapter of Exodus. The only important difference is  that while the making of the calf is attributed to Aaron in the Bible, the Holy Qur’ån  declares that prophet to be innocent in the matter, and ascribes the leadership in the  making of the calf and its worship to Såmirß. The idea of calf, or bull-worship, seems to  have been taken by the Israelites from the Egyptians. In the opinion of Renan, Maspero,  and Konig, “bull-worship may have been an imitation of the worship of Apis at  Memphis or of Mendis at Heliopolis” (En. Bib. col. 631). The writer of the article on the  golden calf is, however, of opinion that “adoption from Egypt is unlikely”, and his chief  reason is that “the Egyptians worshipped only living animals”. But the Israelites, too,  seem to have been addicted to the worship of living animals in the time of Moses, as the  incident narrated in vv. 67–71 shows, and the calf was only an image of a living animal,  and at any rate four hundred years’ contact with the Egyptians could not have been without its influence, bull-worship dating from a very remote antiquity in Egypt. It was for  this reason that the Mosaic law laid great stress upon the slaughter of cows, and the  commandment mentioned in v. 67 seems to have been given for the same reason.  Notwithstanding all that Moses did to uproot this form of idolatry from among the  Israelites, the worshipping of the bull appears to have continued up to the time of Hosea,  who rails at it in very strong terms (Hos. 8: 5; 10: 5). \n\n53a. The original word is furqån, an infinitive noun from the root farq, which  signifies the making of distinction between two things, and furqån, according to LL, is anything that makes a separation or distinction between truth and falsity, and hence it signifies a proof or demonstration and also aid or victory. The furqån or discriminationwhich is here spoken of as being given to Moses was Pharaoh’s drowning in the sea andthe deliverance of the Israelites. The battle of Badr afforded the furqån or discriminationin the case of the Holy Prophet, and hence the battle of Badr is called yaum al-furqån orthe day of discrimination in 8:41.\n\n54a. According to the Bible, the children of Levi were commanded to slay theothers, and three thousand men were killed on that day. On the basis of this Bible story,the words fa-qtul∂ anfusa-kum occurring here have been translated as meaning kill yourpeople. The context does not allow this interpretation. In the first place, the words arepreceded by an order to repent and it could not be followed by an order to kill.Secondly, the words that follow are, so He turned to you mercifully, and an order to killthree thousand people could not be called a merciful dealing. Thirdly, it has alreadybeen made clear in v. 52 that God pardoned them for the offence of taking the calf for agod: Then We pardoned you after that so that you might give thanks. They could not beasked to give thanks for being killed. The order to kill is inconsistent with the statementthat they were pardoned. Fourthly, when the same incident is narrated elsewhere, thereis a clear statement that they were granted a pardon and there is no mention of killing:“Then they took the calf for a god, after clear signs had come to them, but We pardonedthis” (4: 153). Fifthly, according to the Qur’ån even Såmirß, the leader of calf-worship,was not killed and was dismissed simply with the order: “Begone then! It is for thee inthis life to say, Touch (me) not”. (20: 97).Hence the Holy Qur’ån rejects the Bible story of the Israelites being killed as apunishment for calf-worship. They were pardoned and were told simply to repent, andGod accepted their repentance as clearly stated here. Therefore anfusa-kum does notmean here your people, but your desires or your passions, for the word nafs, of whichanfus is the plural, means not only self or soul but also intention, desire or passion. Infact, it was an order not to kill but to mortify, and this is the only interpretation whichcan be given to these words consistent with the clear mention of God’s pardoning themand turning to them mercifully. I may add that no prophet or religion has ever taughtthat a man can be killed for the worship of an object other than God.\n\n55a. The reference to this story contained in the Bible is in Exod. 19: 16,      17: “Andit came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings,and a thick cloud upon the Mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so thatall the people that was in the camp trembled. And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God; and they stood at the nether part of the Mount”. The Talmudgives the details.˝å‘iqah originally signifies thunder or the sound of thunder, and hence any vehementcry (T, LL); it also means any destructive punishment (LL). The same incident isreferred to in 7: 155, in the following words: “And Moses chose of his people seventymen for Our appointment. So when the earthquake overtook them…”. Thus the ©å‘iqahof this verse is the same as the earthquake in 7: 155, and thus it here signifies the rumbling noise which precedes an earthquake.\n\n56a. The word maut does not always mean cessation of life. It also signifies loss ofsensation, deprivation of intellectual faculties, experiencing great grief and sorrow,sleep, etc. (R, LL). The maut mentioned in this verse refers to temporary loss ofsensation, because on the same occasion Moses is spoken of as having fallen down “inswoon” (7: 143), and the statement is followed by the words “when he recovered ”. Asimilar fate overtook his companions.\n\n57a. The Bible speaks of a cloud, clear and bright during the night, thick andgloomy in day time (Exod. 13: 21), a very unnatural phenomenon to continue for fortyyears. The Qur’ån simply speaks of clouds having given them shade at some point intheir journey in the wilderness, when probably the excessive heat of the Arabian Deserthad become unbearable.\n\n57b. The mann and salwå are the manna and quails of Exodus,      16th chapter.Literally, mann is anything which comes to man without much effort (LL). In a sayingof the Holy Prophet the truffle is spoken of as being mann. LL has the followingexplanation under the word turanjabßn: “A kind of manna; the manna of the thornyplants called by the Arabs the håj, and hence by European botanists Alhagi; according toDr. Royle it is a sweetish juice which exudes from the Alhagi maurorum, crystallizesinto small granular masses, and is usually distinguished by the name of Persian manna; akind of dew that falls mostly in Khuråsån and Må-warå al-nahr and in our country,mostly upon the håj; the best thereof is that which is fresh or moist and white (Ibn Sßnå),the mann or manna mentioned in the Qur’ån”. Some say it was honey. Salwå meanswhatever renders one content in a case of privation. It is a certain bird resembling thequail (LL). The mann and the salwå formed the food of the Israelites in the wilderness.According to Zj, it includes all that Allåh bestowed on them as a gift in the wildernessand granted to them freely without much exertion on their part (AH).\n\n58a. The city is probably Shittim: “And they pitched by Jordan, from BethJesimoth even unto Abel-Shittim in the plains of Moab”, or Jericho, which was near by in the same plain (Num. 33: 49,      50). Here it was that the worst features of the wickedness of the Israelites were displayed: “And Israel abode in Shittim, and the people beganto commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab” (Num. 25: 1). Or, the reference maybe to the Holy Land, as stated elsewhere: “O my people, enter the Holy Land whichAllåh has ordained for you” (5: 21).\n\n58b. They were told to remain submissive while abiding in a city where theywould be able to enjoy the comforts of life. See 34a for the significance of sajdah.\n\n58c. ÏiΔΔat-un (from √uΔΔa, meaning he put it down) is a prayer for the puttingdown of the heavy burden of sins from one. The Holy Prophet is reported to have said tohis followers: “Say, We ask forgiveness of Allåh and turn to Him penitently”; and tohave added: “This is, to be sure, the √iΔΔat-un which the Israelites were commanded tosay” (IH, ch. Ïudaibiyah). By qaul the Arabs express all kinds of deeds (A). Q∂l∂ √iΔΔatun therefore stands for a petition for forgiveness or for being repentant.\n\n59a. That is to say, they went against the Divine commandment. The Bible says:“The people began to commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab. And they calledthe people unto the sacrifices of their gods: and the people did eat and bowed down totheir gods. And Israel joined himself unto Baal-Peor, and the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel” (Num. 25: 1–3).\n\n59b. When a punishment overtakes a people as a consequence of their wickeddeeds it is spoken of as coming from heaven, the significance probably being that it cannot be averted. The pestilence spoken of here is referred to in the Bible in Num. 25: 8,      9,according to which 24,      000 men died of the plague. The same incident is again referredto in 7: 161, 162.\n\n60a. The words i˙rib bi‘a©å ka-l-√ajara may be translated in two ways, strike therock with thy staff, or march on or go forth or hasten, to the rock with thy staff. Óarb means striking, smiting, marching on, going from place to place, setting forth a parable,and carries a number of other significances. In fact, ˙arb is used to indicate all kinds ofactions except a few (T). When ar˙ (land or earth) is its object, it carries the significance of going about or seeking a way. Thus ˙araba-l-ar˙a or ˙araba fi-l-ar˙i both signify he journeyed in the land or went forth or hastened in the land (LL). The object ofi˙rib here is al-√ajar which means a rock or a mountain to which there is no access, asexplained by Tha‘labß (LL). ‘A©å ordinarily means staff or rod, but its primary significance is a state of combination (T, LL), and the word is metaphorically used to speak ofa community. Thus of the Khwårij, a Muslim sect, it is said, shaqq∂‘a©a-l-Muslimßna(lit., they broke the staff of the Muslims) which means that they made a schism in thestate of combination and union, or in the community of the Muslims (LA). Hence thewords may mean strike the rock with thy staff, or march on to the mountain with thy staffor thy community.The story that Moses carried a stone with him and that twelve springs flowed from itwhenever, placing it in the wilderness, he struck it with his staff, has no foundation inthe words of the Holy Qur’ån or any saying of the Prophet. What the words of theQur’ån signify is either that Moses was commanded by God to smite a particular rockwith his staff from which water flowed forth miraculously, or to march on to a mountainfrom which springs flowed. The Bible does not contain any contemporaneous record ofthe events, and what it contains does not render much help. In Exod. 17: 1–6 we are toldthat Moses went with the elders to the rock of Horeb, and on his smiting the rock withhis rod water flowed out, but there is no mention of twelve springs there. But as Marah(Exod. 15: 23) is now known by the name of ‘uy∂n M∂så, i.e., the springs of Moses (Bib.Dict., Cambridge Press, Art. “Wilderness”), it is very doubtful whether the incidentreferred to in Exod. 17: 1–6 is correctly recorded, the more so as there is hopelessconfusion about the other incidents related to have occurred at Rephidim, the scene ofthe smiting of the rock.\n\n 60b. The number of springs is in accordance with the number of the Israelite tribes.It is very probable that the reference in this verse is to the twelve wells at Elim (Exod.15: 27), to which place the Israelites had gone from Marah. Moreover, the twelve tribescould settle on twelve springs apart from each other only if the springs were situated at adistance from each other and did not flow from one source. Compare also the next verse,according to which the demand for a variety of foods is granted by pointing out thenatural course of settling in a town and tilling the ground.\n\n 61a. “We remember the fish which we did eat in Egypt freely; the cucumbers andthe melons and the leeks and the onions and the garlic. But now our soul is dried away,there is nothing at all besides this manna before our eyes ... Then Moses heard the peopleweep throughout their families, every man in the door of his tent” (Num. 11: 5–10).\n\n61b. The Israelites were required to live a hard life which would make them fit forconquering the Holy Land; this was better for them. But they wanted to live a life ofease and to have all kinds of food which they could get only by settling in towns andtilling the land.\n\n61c. Sale’s translation, “Get ye down into Egypt,” is decidedly wrong. The wordmi©r is used here as a common noun, and means a city. Hazeroth (Num. 11: 35) seems tohave been the place referred to here, “a station in the desert journey, the second afterleaving Senai, probably to be identified with the modern ‘Ain al-Huderah, about fortymiles N.E. of Jabal M∂så” (Bib. Dict., Cam.).\n\n61d. The verse speaks of the ultimate condition to which the Israelites werereduced when they persisted in setting at naught the Divine commandments andindulged in immoral and depraved practices. A comparison with 3: 112 will show thetruth of this remark, for that verse, which is almost identical with the one underdiscussion, clearly refers to the later history of Israel. The truth of this prophecyregarding the fate of the Jewish nation is amply borne out by Jewish history. The Jewsare the wealthiest of nations but their lot is miserable in almost every country of theworld, notwithstanding their great influence in politics it remains so to this day. Moseshad promised the same fate for them: “The Lord shall scatter thee among all people,from one end of the earth even unto the other ... And among those nations thou shaltfind no ease, neither shall the sole of thy foot have rest; but the Lord shall give theethere a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and sorrow of mind” (Deut. 28: 64,      65). \n\n61e. Jesus also holds the Jews guilty for “all the righteous blood shed upon theearth, from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias” (Matt. 23: 35), andcondemns them for their hypocritical assertion that “if we had been in the days of ourfathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets” (Matt.23: 30). There is an allusion here to the Jewish plans against the life of the Prophet also.The word qatl signifies sometimes an attempt to kill or the doing of things which maylead to murder whether murder actually takes place or not (RM). Whether any prophetswere actually killed or not is a different question, but they undoubtedly tried to killprophets, and made several attempts to kill the Holy Prophet Mu√ammad too. \n\n62a. The Sabians are mentioned in the Holy Qur’ån on three occasions only, hereand in 5: 69 along with the Jews and the Christians, and in 22: 17 with these and theMagians. According to En. Br., the Sabians were a semi-Christian sect of Babylonia,closely resembling the so-called “Christians of St. John the Baptist”. The probablederivation of the name is traced to an Aramaic root, and the root meaning is said to bethose who wash themselves, and this is said to be corroborated by Arab writers applyingto them the name of al-Mughtasilah. The idea that the Sabians were star-worshippers isrejected; the error, it is said, being due to the pseudo-Sabians of Harrian, who chose tobe known by that name in the reign of Al-Måm∂n, in 830 A.D., in order to be classed asthe “People of the Book”. The commentators hold different opinions regarding them,most of them agreeing that they are representatives of a religion between Judaism andChristianity, based on the doctrine of unity, but also maintaining worship of angels. Themajority do not include them in the Ahl al-Kitåb (AH).\n\n62b. This verse strikes at the root of the idea of a favoured nation whose membersalone may be entitled to salvation. The subject is introduced here to show that even theJews, notwithstanding their transgressions which had made them deserving of Divinewrath, were entitled to a goodly reward if they believed and did good deeds. It should beborne in mind that, as shown in 4b, belief in Allåh and the Last Day is equivalent tobelief in Islåm as the true religion. The statement made amounts to this, that salvationcannot be attained by mere lip-profession by any people, not even by the Muslims,unless they adhere to a true belief and do good deeds. As to those who stick to their ownreligions, we are told in 22: 17 that “Allåh will decide between them on the day ofResurrection”. The existence of good men in other religions is not denied by the HolyQur’ån, but perfect peace, or the state of absolute contentment which is indicated byfreedom from fear and grief, is obtainable only in Islåm, because Islåm alone is the religion of absolute submission to the Divine Being. \n\n63a. “They stood at the nether part of the mount” (Exod. 19: 17). There is nothingin the words of the Qur’ån to support the baseless story that the mountain was suspended in mid-heaven over the heads of the Israelites to frighten them into submission (see7: 171a). The use of the word raf‘ is in accordance with the Arabic idiom, for it signifiesthe rearing or uprearing of a building, or making it high or lofty (R, LL). In this sensethe word is used in v. 127.\n\n65a. The root meaning of sabt (from which Sabt, meaning Sabbath, is derived) iscutting off (R). The Sabt or the Sabbath is so called because the Jews ceased thereonfrom work (T). The Jews and the Christians observed a particular day for religious worship, and they were forbidden to do any work on that day. In this sense there is noSabbath among the Muslims, because in Islåm no particular day is set apart for Divineworship. On the other hand, the Muslim is required to pray in the very midst of his everyday work, and even the Jumu‘ah (Friday) prayers are no exception, for the Qur’ånexpressly allows the doing of work both before and after the Jumu‘ah prayers (see 62: 9a).The commandments regarding the observance of the Sabbath by the Jews are manifold, but we find the Jews so persistently violating them that the later prophets openlyreproved them for it (see next note).\n\n65b. Mjd explains this in the following words: They were not transformed or metamorphosed; it is only a parable which Allåh has set forth for them, the like of what Hehas set forth in likening them to asses (62: 5), i.e., their hearts were transformed, not thatthey were metamorphosed into apes (IJ). The verse that follows lends support to thisexplanation as a monkey could not afford a lesson to the generations that came after themetamorphosis had taken place. R observes in explaining this verse: It is said that Herather made them morally like apes. Compare also 5: 60: “they are those whom Allåhhas cursed and upon whom He brought His wrath and of whom He made apes andswine, and who serve the devil. These are in a worse plight and further astray from thestraight path”. This description of the same people clearly shows that it is men whoimitate apes and swine that are meant. See also 4: 47: “Or (We shall) curse them as Wecursed the Sabbath-breakers”. Now, in the case of the Holy Prophet’s opponents fromamong the Jews, who are referred to in the words, We shall curse them, there was nometamorphosis, but here it is stated that the same curse must overtake them asovertook the Sabbath-breakers. A reference to Deut. 28 will show that the curses whichMoses prophesied for them meant their being scattered among the nations of the earth,and this was the fate which overtook the Prophet’s enemies from among theJews. Qiradah is the plural of qird, meaning an ape, and among the Arabs the ape is aproverbially incontinent animal, they say more incontinent than an ape (LL).Turning to the Bible, we find that the Israelites became apes, in all the senses inwhich that word is used in the Arabic language, by violating the Divine commandments:“Thou hast despised Mine holy things, and hast profaned My Sabbaths. In thee are menthat carry tales to shed blood: and in thee they eat upon the mountains; in the midst ofthee they commit lewdness. In thee have they discovered their father’s nakedness: inthee have they humbled her that was set apart for pollution. And one hath committedabomination with his neighbour’s wife; and another hath lewdly defiled his daughter-inlaw; and another in thee hath humbled his sister, his father’s daughter ... And I will scatter thee among the heathen and disperse thee in the countries” (Ezek. 22: 8–15). \n\n67a. The slaughter of the cow referred to in this verse has nothing in common withthe slaying of a heifer as an expiation of an uncertain murder in Deut. 21: 1–9, or theslaughter of a red heifer, the ashes of which purify one who has touched the dead bodyof any man (Num. 19: 1–19), except the fact that as the Israelites held the cow in greathonour, and even worshipped it, as is clear from their worship of the golden calf, theywere ordered to slaughter such cows as were usually let abroad and worshipped assacred objects — cows not wrought with, nor drawn in yoke, but let loose to wanderabroad. The cow mentioned in these verses is a typical cow answering this description.This type of cow is still an object of special reverence in India, and the slaughter of thisparticular type was especially enjoined upon the Jews, according to the Bible as well asthe Holy Qur’ån, the object being to root out cow-worship from among them. Butwhereas the Biblical injunction to slaughter a heifer is a general injunction to beobserved whenever an uncertain murder takes place or an unclean person is to bepurified, the injunction as contained in the Qur’ån points to the slaughter of one particular cow which was probably likely to become an object of worship. Indeed, there is astriking resemblance between the colour of the golden calf and the cow ordered to beslaughtered. The concluding words of the section show that, because of their reverencefor that particular cow, the Jews were very averse to slaughter it. The red heifer “had awhole treatise to itself in the Mishna, where its qualifications were elaborated to such apoint that at last R. Nisin said that no one since the days of Moses had been able to findone fit to be slain” (En. Bib., col. 846). This remark clearly suggests that in the time ofMoses one fit to be slain and answering that description had been found. For theIsraelites’ worship of cows, see 51b.\n\n71a. The concluding words of this verse, as well as those of the 69th, show that thecow which the Israelites were commanded to slaughter was one specially venerated bythem. It was delightful in appearance, and the Israelites were averse to slaughter it. Thisshows that this particular cow was likely to become an object of worship among them,and hence Moses’ precaution. The directions contained in Deut. 21: 1–9 and elsewherein regard to the slaughter of this type of cow show further precautions against a similartendency of the Israelite mind.\n\n72a. The story generally narrated by the commentators to explain this passage isnot based on any saying of the Holy Prophet; nor is it met with in the Bible. The veryindefiniteness of the incident is an indication that it refers to some well-known event inhistory, and as almost all incidents of the stubbornness of the Jewish nation prior to thetime of Jesus have been mentioned, it becomes almost certain that this incident refers toJesus himself, as it was with respect to his death that disagreement took place and manydoubted his death. This inference becomes stronger when we compare the incidents narrated here with the same incidents as narrated in the fourth chapter in vv. 153–157,where, after enumerating almost all the incidents narrated here in the three previous sections, the Qur’ån goes on to accuse the Jews in the following words: “And for their saying: We have killed the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, the messenger of Allåh, and theykilled him not, nor did they cause his death on the cross, but he was made to appear tothem as such. And certainly those who differ therein are in doubt about it. They have noknowledge about it, but only follow a conjecture” (4: 157). The part quoted answersexactly to vv. 72 and 73, only that the name is omitted here. This comparison makes it clear that it is the apparent killing of Jesus that is referred to here. The words you killed(Ar. qataltum) are used, because in the first place the Jews asserted that they had killedhim, and secondly because metaphorically a person may be said to have been killedwhen he is made to appear as if he were dead. Thus in the well-known saying, idhå måmåta mait-un (lit., when a dead man dies), the word dead really signifies not the deadman, but one who is about to die. ‘Umar’s saying, uqtul∂ S‘ad-an, is explained by LA asmeaning, make him like one who is slain. LA also allows the use of the word qatl for asevere punishment in cases in which the drunkard and the habitual thief are spoken of asdeserving of qatl in certain sayings of early-day judges. \n\n 72b. The Jews wanted to kill Jesus, but God ordained that he should not die. Thiswas the bringing forth of that which they were going to hide. \n\n73a. The construction of the phrase, i˙rib∂-hu bi-ba‘˙i-hå, is rather difficult, but acomparison with 4: 157 makes the meaning clear. Óarb, as shown in 60a, conveys anumber of significations. It means striking as well as likening, and an instance of the latter significance we find in the Qur’ån itself, where it is said ya˙ribu-llåhu-l-√aqqa wa-lbåΔila, Allåh compares truth and falsehood (13: 17). In ba‘˙i-hå (lit., a part of it), thepersonal pronoun hå, i.e., it, refers to the act of murder. The act of murder was notcompleted in the case of Jesus, as the Gospels show, for after he was taken down fromthe cross his legs were not broken, as in the case of the thieves. The meaning of thesentence is therefore according to the signification of ˙arb that we adopt: strike him withpartial death, or liken his condition to that of the partially dead man; and thus he wasmade to appear as a dead man, as stated in 4:157. There is no other case of a murder oran attempted murder in Jewish history of which the whole nation could be said to havebeen guilty, and which might answer to the description of these two verses. \n\n73b. This was really a case of giving life to the dead, for Jesus Christ was dead toall appearance. Those actually dead do not return to life in this world; see 21: 95a,      23: 100a and 39: 42a\n\n74a. The hardened hearts are likened to rocks, and then they are metaphoricallyspoken of as bursting forth so that streams of water flow from them; others are spoken ofas splitting asunder so that water flows from them; others still as falling down for fear ofAllåh. The significance is clear; even hardened hearts would receive life — nay more, they would give life to others, be a source of spiritual life for others as water andstreams are sources of life in the physical world.\n\n 75a. That the Israelites did not preserve their sacred books in their purity is aconstant charge laid by the Holy Qur’ån against the Jews. In fact, the alteration andcorruption of the various books of the Bible is now proved beyond all doubt; see 79a.\n\n 76a. They remonstrate with their less careful co-religionists who would talk of theprophecies of the advent of the promised Prophet, telling them that the Muslims wouldbenefit by these disclosures in the sight of their Lord. The absurdity of this argument ismade clear in the next verse. Truth was truth in the sight of Allåh whether they made itknown or not.\n\n 78a. The word translated here as illiterate is ummiyy∂n, plural of ummß, which signifies one who neither writes nor reads a writing (R). The word is, therefore, speciallyapplied to the Arabs, who were generally unacquainted with reading and writing,exceptions being rare. It is, however, here applied to the illiterate Jews; see also 7: 157a.The Jewish masses had no access to their own sacred books which were known only totheir learned men, and therefore religious ideas were based only on stories which theyknew from hearsay. The word amånß is plural of umniyyah which means a desire andalso carries the significance of lying, because desire leads to lies (R). Some understandby it the repetition of words without knowing their significance. What is said here aboutthe Jews is to a very large extent true of the Muslims of our day. In the early days ofIslåm, every individual Muslim, man as well as woman, sought light direct from theQur’ån. Not so the Muslims in this age who depend entirely on their learned men. They do read the Qur’ån but look upon mere recitation as a meritorious deed without trying tolearn what it says, and then act upon it. \n\n 79a. The alteration and corruption of the Bible, the Old as well as the NewTestament, spoken of in v. 75 and repeated here, is now an established fact. That thealteration spoken of in v. 75 was an alteration of the words of the text is made manifesthere: “They write the Book with their hands then say: This is from Allåh”. These alterations they effected for their own selfish ends. “That they may take for it a small price”.I give below a few quotations from Rev. Dummelow, which prove the alteration of theBible text beyond all doubt: “On close examination, however, it must be admitted thatthe Pentateuch reveals many features inconsistent with the traditional view that in itspresent form it is the work of Moses. For instance, it may be safely granted that Mosesdid not write the account of his own death in Dt. 34. The statement in Dt. 1: 1 that Mosesspoke these words beyond Jordan is evidently made from the standpoint of one living inCanaan, which Moses never did .... Other passages which can with difficulty be ascribedto him are Ex. 6: 26,      27; 11: 3; 16: 35,      36; Lv. 18: 24–28; Nu. 12: 3; Dt. 2: 12” (BibleCommentary, p. xxiv). And again: “A careful examination has led many scholars to theconviction that the writings of Moses formed only the rough material or purport of thematerial, and that in its present form it is not the work of one man, but a compilationmade from previously existing documents” (p. xxvi). Still again: “Similarly in thelegislative portions of these books we find apparent contradictions and these not inminor or insignificant details, but in fundamental enactments” (p. xxvi). The text of theNew Testament is still more unreliable. The same author says: “To begin with, thewriters of the Gospels report in Greek ... the sayings of Jesus Christ, who for the mostpart probably spoke Aramaic ... Not even in later centuries do we find that scrupulousregard for the sacred text which marked the transmission of the Old Testament. Acopyist would sometimes put in not what was in the text, but what he thought ought tobe in it. He would trust a fickle memory, or he would even make the text accord with theviews of the school to which he belonged” (p. xvi).\n\n80a. “It is a received opinion among the Jews at present that no person, be he everso wicked, or of whatever sect, shall remain in hell above eleven months, or at most ayear, except Dathan and Abiram and atheists, who will be tormented there to all eternity”(Sale).\n\n81a. The inmates of the Fire are here stated to be those who earn evil, and findthemselves beset on every side by their evil deeds. These are the men who give themselves up to evil, and who therefore ultimately find themselves in the power of evil,which even in this life, but more palpably in the life after death, assumes the form of aburning fire. It should be noted that the man who struggles against evil, however longthat struggle may take, to overcome an evil inclination, is not the man who earns evil,because the earnest struggle in which the fighter against evil hates and detests evil, andseeks to overcome it, always ends in a victory for the good and noble qualities in man.\n\n82a. This verse speaks of those whose lives are devoted to the doing of good asagainst those who earn evil, spoken of in the last verse. It should be noted that, thoughrefraining from evil is a praiseworthy thing, the doing of good occupies a much higherplace. Sinlessness is simply a preparatory ground for the development of self, while thatdevelopment consists in the doing of good.The doers of good are called a©√åb al-Jannat or owners of the Garden. The worda©√åb is pl. of ©å√ib which means a companion or an owner. I have translated a©√åb alnår as companions of the Fire but a©√åb al-Jannat as owners of the Garden, becausewhile the inmates of the Fire will be taken out of it after being purged of the evil, of theinmates of paradise it is said that it is “a gift never to be cut off ” (11: 108), and that thosein it will never be ejected from it (15: 48). As to the reason for calling the righteous theowners of the Garden or describing the fruit of their labour as Gardens in which riversflow, see 25a.\n\n83a. Allåh’s making a covenant with a people signifies His giving commandmentsto them. Compare Deut. 4: 13: “And He declared unto you His covenant, which He commanded you to perform”. \n\n83b. Compare Exod. 20: 3: “Thou shalt have no other gods before Me”, and Exod.23: 25: “And ye shall serve the Lord your God”, and various other places. \n\n83c. Compare Exod. 20: 12, and Deut. 5: 16: “Honour thy father and thy mother”. \n\n83d. Compare Deut. 15: 11: “Thou shalt open thine hand wide unto thy brother, tothy poor, and to thy needy, in thy land”. \n\n83e. The word qaul (speaking) is used to express all kinds of deeds (N), and hencethe speaking of good words to all stands for kind dealing with all.\n\n83f. Prayer and zakåt as enjoined on the Israelites differed from the Islåmic prayerand zakåt in details. The directions regarding poor-rate among the Israelites are contained in Deut. 14: 28,      29: “At the end of three years thou shalt bring forth all the tithe ofthine increase the same year, and shalt lay it up within thy gates. And the Levite(because he hath no part nor inheritance with thee), and the stranger, and the fatherless,and the widow, which are within thy gates, shall come, and shall eat and be satisfied;that the Lord thy God may bless thee in all the work of thine hand which thou doest”.\n\n84a. The previous verse speaks of a covenant with the Children of Israel while thisone speaks of a covenant with you. The reference here is to the important treaty of mutual obligation in writing which the Holy Prophet entered into with the Jews when he settled at Madßnah. By this treaty the Muslims and the Jews were bound not only not toturn their hands against each other but also to defend one another against a commonenemy. In fact, this treaty aimed at a perfect union among the discordant elements of thepopulation of Madßnah. I quote a few clauses of this treaty: “Whosoever is rebellious orseeketh to spread enmity and sedition, the hand of every man shall be against him, evenif he be a son ... Whosoever of the Jews followeth us shall have aid and succour; theyshall not be injured, nor shall any enemy be aided against them ... The Jewish clans inalliance with the several tribes of Madßnah are one people with the believers. ... TheJews will profess their religion, the Muslims theirs. As with the Jews so with theiradherents. No one shall go forth to war excepting with the permission of Mu√ammad,but this shall not hinder any from seeking lawful revenge. The Jews shall be responsiblefor their expenditure, the Muslims for theirs; but if attacked, each shall come to theassistance of the other. Madßnah shall be sacred and inviolable for all that join thistreaty. Controversies and disputes shall be referred to the decision of God and HisProphet. None shall join the men of Makkah or their allies, for verily the engaging parties are bound together against every one that shall threaten Madßnah. War and peaceshall be made in common” (IH-Muir).\n\n84a. The previous verse speaks of a covenant with the Children of Israel while thisone speaks of a covenant with you.

War and peaceshall be made in common” (IH-Muir).85a. There is a prophetic reference here to the Jewish attitude towards the Muslimslater on when they secretly made an alliance with the Quraish who attacked Madßnah.Thus in a later s∂rah: “And He drove down those of the People of the Book who backed them (i.e. the Quraish), from their fortresses” (33: 26). The reference here is to the BanßQurai˚ah, who were in alliance with the Prophet, but when the Quraish attackedMadßnah, which, under the treaty, they were bound to repel, they secretly sided with theinvading army; see 33: 26a. Under the treaty, the Muslims and the Jews were one peopleand hence they are spoken of, in the opening words of the verse, as slaying their ownpeople. The two Jewish tribes, the Qainuqå‘ and the Banß Na˙ßr, were also guilty ofintriguing with the enemy and violating the treaty. \n\n85b. The reference in these words is to the terms of the original treaty under whichthe Jews were bound to ransom the Muslims if they were made captives by an enemy.They did not openly repudiate the treaty but intrigued with the enemy to turn theMuslims out of Madßnah. The reference in believing in a part of the book and disbelieving in the other is to this conduct of the Jews. Most commentators, however, understandthat the reference here is to the alliance which the two Jewish tribes, Qurai˚ah andNa˙ßr, living side by side at Madßnah, had made with Aus and Khazraj, the two rivaltribes of Madßnah respectively. When the latter fought against each other, their alliestook part in the fighting, and thus one Jewish tribe slaughtered and imprisoned the otherand laid waste their habitations, but afterwards collected subscriptions for the release ofthe Jewish prisoners, on the ground that the law commanded them to redeem the prisoners and they fought against their co-religionists for the honour of their allies. The punishment or disgrace which they are threatened with at the end of the verse was witnessedby all the three Jewish tribes of Madßnah, the Qainuqå‘, the Nadßr, and the Qurai˚ah, onaccount of their violation of the treaty, and making secret alliances with the enemies ofIslåm in the hope that they would succeed in turning the Muslims out of Madßnah.\n\n87a. The Hebrew for Jesus is Yas∂‘, but in Arabic it is always ‘Íså, and generallythe epithet Ibn Maryam (son of Mary) is added to it, to show that he was a mortal likeother prophets of God. The long chain of prophets that came after Moses ended in Jesus,Moses being the first and Jesus the last prophet of the Israelite dispensation.Jesus is here spoken of as having been given clear arguments and strengthened withthe Holy Spirit, yet he too was rejected by the Jews. The idea of the Holy Ghost as metwith in Christian religious literature is quite different from and opposed to the Jewishconception of the Holy Spirit which Islåm accepts. The Christians believe in the HolyGhost as one of the three persons of Divinity and not as a creation of God, for whichthere is not the least ground in Jewish religious thought. Even among the Christians theidea was of a later growth, as we find both Zacharias and John spoken of as being filledwith the Holy Ghost.According to the Holy Qur’ån, the Holy Spirit is the angel which brought revelation: “The Holy Spirit has revealed it (i.e. the Qur’ån) from thy Lord” (16: 102). TheHoly Spirit is mentioned by two other names, Gabriel (v. 97) and the Faithful Spirit(26: 193). So Jesus’ being strengthened with the Holy Spirit only means that he wasgranted Divine revelation like other prophets before him. \n\n87b. The change of tense from the past to the optative is an allusion to the attemptswhich were then being made on the life of the Holy Prophet. Rz thus explains thischange: “For you seek by devices the murder of Mu√ammad, were it not that I hadprotected him from you”. \n\n88a. Ghulf carries two significances. It is plural of ghilåf, which means a covering,a case or a repository. The meaning in this case would be that their hearts were reposi -tories of knowledge and they stood in no need of any further knowledge. Ghulf is alsoplural of aghlaf which means enclosed in a covering (LL), and the significance in thiscase is that their hearts were covered from hearing and accepting what the Prophet said. \n\n88b. Curse, as implying an imprecation of evil, is not the exact equivalent ofla‘nat, which implies the banishing and estranging of one from good (LA), though itmust necessarily be adopted as such for want of another simple equivalent. Theallegation of the Israelites was that, being descendants of prophets, their hearts were therepositories of knowledge, and being already, as it were, full of knowledge, they did notstand in need of more. They are told that it was really their disbelief which became thecause of their estrangement from the good which the Holy Prophet had brought.\n\n89a. The Jews expected that when the Prophet spoken of in Deut. 18: 18 came, hewould make them victorious over their disbelieving opponents: “And it shall come topass, if thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of the Lord thy God, to observe andto do all His commandments which I command thee this day, that the Lord thy God willset thee on high above all nations of the earth: and all these blessings shall come on thee,and overtake thee, if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God” (Deut. 28: 1,      2). Read it along with Deut. 18: 15–19, and the significance of “hearkening” becomesclear. As to the fact that the Jews were still waiting for the appearance of the PromisedProphet, see John 1: 25; “Why baptizest thou, then, if thou be not the Christ, nor Elias,neither that prophet”; that prophet, as in John 1: 21, referring to the promised prophet ofDeut. 18: 15 and 18. This shows clearly that they waited for three different prophets.Acts 3: 21–23 also shows that the Prophet spoken of in Deut. 18: 18 was still waited forafter the death of Christ. \n\n 91a. By saying that they believed in that which was revealed to them, they assertedthat they could accept only a revelation granted to an Israelite. The reply to this is thatthe revelation of the Holy Prophet is the truth verifying that which is contained in theirown Scriptures, the reference being to the prophecies of the advent of the Holy Prophetcontained in Deut. 18: 15–18 and other places. \n\n 91b. They are shown guilty out of their own mouths. Their contention was thatthey would believe only in a revelation which was granted to an Israelite prophet. Yetthey tried to kill even Israelite prophets, which shows that it was their hard-heartednesswhich prevented them from accepting the truth, whether that truth was revealed throughan Israelite or a non-Israelite prophet. \n\n93a. The original word is isma‘∂, meaning primarily hear or listen, but it may alsomean obey (AH), a meaning given to it in the Qur’ån itself in 36:25. It may also meanaccept (LL). The sense of the word as used here is made clear by the similar expressionin v. 63: “And when We made a covenant with you and raised the mountain above you:Hold fast that which We have given you, and bear in mind what is in it”. \n\n93b. They did not utter these words with their tongues, but it is an expression oftheir condition, for the word qaul is used to denote what is expressive of the condition ofa thing. Qålati-l-‘ainåni means the eyes showed (not spoke) (T). Kf explains the wordsas meaning, we hear the words and we disobey the command. \n\n93c. The words used here signify that they had imbibed the love of the calf. Theuse of the word qul∂b (hearts) shows clearly that it was a thing that had gone deep downinto their hearts; nothing was taken by mouth. According to Exod. 32: 20 and Deut. 9: 21the Israelites were actually made to drink of the water on which the ashes of the calfwere strewed. The Holy Qur’ån makes it clear in 20: 97 that the ashes of the calf werescattered by being thrown into the sea.\n\n94a. According to I‘Ab tamannawu-l-mauta (lit., desire death) signifies invokedeath on the party that lies or is false in its assertion (IJ). A similar challenge, but infuller words, is contained in 3: 61: “Whoever then disputes with thee in this matter afterthe knowledge that has come to thee, say: Come! let us call our sons and your sons,and our women and your women, and our people and your people, then let us be earnestin prayer and invoke the curse of Allåh on the liars”. This challenge is given to theChristians, and the same challenge in fewer words is given here to the Jews.\n\n96a. By those who set up gods with God, are meant the Christians, because theyalso hold the polytheistic belief of the Divinity of a man. They too refused to accept theProphet’s challenge of the mubåhalah (3: 61) on account of the love of this life. As totheir desire of living for a thousand years and its fulfilment, as indicated here, see20: 103a. It would thus mean the life of a people in prosperity and not the life of an individual. Or, the reference may be to the Zoroastrians who, when invoking a blessing onanyone, prayed that he should live for a thousand years. \n\n97a. Michael was regarded by the Jews as a friend, “the great prince which standethfor the children of thy people” (Dan 12: 1). And they looked upon Gabriel as their enemy,because he was considered to be an avenging angel who brought down Divine punishment upon the guilty. But in the Bible, as in the Holy Qur’ån, Gabriel is mentioned asdelivering Divine messages to men, as in Dan. 8: 16 and in Luke 1: 19 and 26. Accordingto Muqåtal, the Jews considered Gabriel as their enemy because they thought that he wascharged to convey the gift of prophecy to the Israelites, and he conveyed it to anotherpeople, i.e., Ishmaelites (Rz). Some commentators look upon both the words Jibrßl andMßkål as foreign words having no derivation in Arabic (AH), but others consider Jibrßl asa combinaton of jabr, meaning a servant, and ßl meaning Allåh, and Mßkål as made up ofmßk and ßl, the word mßk having the same significance as jabr (IJ). \n\n97b. The word idhn signifies permission, leave or concession of liberty to do athing; and sometimes command, likewise will; also knowledge (LL).\n\n98a. The enmity of man to Allåh and Allåh to man is thus explained: “In realitythere can be no enmity between Allåh and man; as to man’s enmity to Allåh, it signifiesopposition to His commandments, and as to Allåh’s enmity to man, it signifies therecompense for his opposition” (AH). Note that Allåh is here said to be an enemy tothose disbelievers only who first make themselves enemies to the prophets of Allåh, andhence also to the angels and the Divine Being Himself. The same law of the punishmentof an evil being spoken of in the terms of that evil really finds an expression here, as isreferred to in 15a.\n\n101a. The covenant referred to in the previous verse as being cast aside, and thethrowing of the Book behind their backs, both refer to the Israelites paying no heed tothe prophecy of Deut. 18: 18, which was verified by the advent of the Holy Prophet. Soclearly did that prophecy point to the Holy Prophet that it is again and again referred toin this chapter as the most powerful argument against the inimical attitude of the Jews.\n\n102a. According to an interpretation accepted by all commentators, by the devilshere are meant human devils, or devils in the form of men (AH, Rz).\n\n102b. Yaq∂lu ‘alai-hi means such a one lies or says what is false against such aone; yatl∂ ‘alai-hi sometimes carries the same significance (T, LL). Rz says talå ‘alai-himeans he lied. This is the significance here. \n\n102c. By the mulk of Solomon is here meant his prophethood or kingdom (AH, Rz).The Jews attributed Solomon’s glory to certain devilish crafts, and this is the lie whichthey are spoken of here as having forged against Solomon (Rz).\n\n102d. In this respect the Holy Qur’ån contradicts the Bible, which says that thewives of Solomon “turned away his heart after other gods” (1 Kings 11: 4), and that “theLord was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned from the Lord God ofIsrael” (1 Kings 11: 9). It is now established that the statement of the Bible is wrong inthis respect. The Rev. T.K. Cheyne has shown conclusively that Solomon was “not apolytheist”, and, having shown how mistakes crept into the Bible statement, heconcludes: “That Solomon had a number of wives, both Israelite and non-Israelite, isprobable enough, but he did not make altars for all of them, nor did he himself combinethe worship of his wives’ gods with that of Yahwe” (En. Bib. col. 4689). \n\n102e. According to Jauharß everything of which the origin is subtle is si√r. Theprimary significance is the turning of a thing from its proper manner of being to anothermanner (T, LL). Thus sa√ara-h∂ bi-kalåmi-hß means he caused him to incline to him byhis soft or elegant speech (Mgh). Hence it is applied to skilful eloquence, and hence alsothe saying of the Prophet: Inna mina-l-bayåni la-si√r-an, i.e., verily there is a kind ofeloquence that is enchantment (si√r). And also sa√ara-h∂ means he deceived or beguiledhim (Q). And sa√artu-l-fi˙˙ata signifies I gilded silver (LL). Si√r is also synonymouswith fasåd (T), thus signifying the act of corrupting, marring, spoiling, etc. It is also theproducing of what is false in the form of truth, and embellishment by falsification anddeceit. Hence the word si√r carries a very wide significance, and its use in Arabic is notequivalent to that of sorcery in the English language.\n\n102f. According to Sale, the Persian Magi “mention two rebellious angels of thesame names, now hung up by the feet with their heads downwards, in the territory ofBabel”. A similar story is met with in the Jewish traditions in Midrash. Stories aboutsinning angels were also believed in by the Christians; see Second Epistle of Peter, ii. 4,and Epistle of Jude, v. 6. Upon these stories seem to be based the lengthy fables of somecommentators, but the more learned reject them. Not only does the Qur’ån not contain a word of these stories, but it plainly discredits them by denying that sorcery was revealedto certain angels at Babel, or that angels taught sorcery to men, giving them at the sametime the warning, as was the common belief: We are only a trial, so disbelieve not. Thisstatement was added to the story to save the character of the angels as penitents. TheArabic lexicons give the two words Hår∂t and Mår∂t under the roots hart and mart, andexplain harata as meaning he rent a thing and marata as meaning he broke a thing.The statement made in the Qur’ån amounts to this. The Jews, instead of followingthe word of God, followed certain evil crafts which they falsely attributed to Solomonand to two angels at Babel. Solomon is declared free of any such sinfulness attributed tohim, and the story of the two angels is declared to be a fabrication. But the Jews areblamed for learning from these two sources, i.e., by their fabrications against Solomonand the story of the two angels, things by which they made a distinction between a manand his wife. The personal pronoun humå (meaning two) refers to these two fabrications.The clue to what this was is contained in the words they cannot hurt with it anyoneexcept with Allåh’s permission, showing that by this craft they intended to inflict someinjury on the Prophet. Similar words are met with in chapter 58 where, after denouncingthe secret counsels of the enemies of Islåm, it is said in v. 10: “Secret counsels are only(the work) of the devil that he may cause to grieve those who believe, and he can hurtthem naught except with Allåh’s permission”. It is evident that the 58th chapter wasrevealed at Madßnah, where secret counsels of the nature of masonic societies werecarried on against the Prophet by the Jews, and these secret counsels are stated to be thework of the devil, the expression being closely parallel to what is stated in the verseunder discussion, where the Jews are spoken of as following the devil while ascribingtheir evil doctrines to prophets and angels. In 58: 10 we also see that the object of thesesecret counsels was to cause hurt to the Prophet and to the Muslims, and the same isstated to be the object of the evil machinations of the Jews in the verse under discussion.These considerations point clearly to the fact that the secret counsels of the Jewsmentioned in chapter 58 are referred to here. It is further clear that the words by whichthey make a distinction between a man and his wife refer to secret gatherings of thenature of masonic societies, for it is in freemasonry and in no other religious society ofthe world that women are totally excluded. Instead of mentioning freemasonry itself,therefore, its distinctive characteristic is mentioned. And however untrustworthy may bethe old histories of freemasonry, there is no doubt that the institution is an ancient one,“having subsisted from time immemorial” (En. Br.). The statement made in the “Bookof Constitutions” that Cyrus constituted Jerubbabel grand master in Judah (En. Br.) maynot be without a substratum of truth.\n\n 104a. Rå‘i-nå is equivalent to give ear to, hearken, or listen to us, but with a slightchange of accent it becomes ra‘ina, which means he is foolish or stupid or unsound inintellect, the derivation in the first case being from ra‘y, to pasture or to be mindful, andin the second case from ra‘n, i.e., being foolish (LL). The Jews in derision changed theaccent, “distorting” the word, as stated in 4: 46, and thus made it a term of reproach. Theword un˚ur-nå, which means wait for us or grant us a little delay, is suggested instead,because it cannot be distorted like its equivalent rå‘i-nå. The Muslims are hereforbidden to use a certain form of expression, but the real object is to show how greatwas the hatred of the Jews towards the Holy Prophet, so that they did not observe eventhe ordinary rules of decency. Morally the injunction is one worthy of the highestregard, as it disapproves of the use of words bearing a sinister meaning. \n\n 105a. Khair, lit., good, and ra√mat, lit., mercy, both stand here for Divinerevelation, for it was this good which the Jews would not like to be sent down to theMuslims, and it was this mercy for which the Muslims had been chosen (AH). \n\n106a. Reading the verse under discussion in the light of the context, it is clear thatthe Jews are addressed here. The two previous sections deal, more or less, with aparticular Jewish objection to the revelation of the Prophet, viz., that they could notaccept a new revelation which was not granted to an Israelite. This is plainly stated invv. 90 and 91. The same subject is continued, the Jews being addressed throughout.Their objection was: Why was another revelation sent down to Mu√ammad, and whywas a law containing new commandments promulgated? That objection was to beanswered. The answer is given partly in v. 105, and partly in the verse under discussion.In the former of these they are told that Allåh chooses whom He pleases for His revelation. In the latter, that if one law (i.e. the Jewish law) was abrogated, one better than itwas given through the Holy Prophet. It should be noted that the new law is here stated tobe better than the one abrogated or like it. It is a fact that though the law of the Qur’ån isdecidedly superior to and more comprehensive than the previous laws in most respects,yet there are many points of likeness in the two. Hence the words one like it are added.In the verse that follows, attention is called to the laws of nature as prevailing in theuniverse. Is it not true that the old order in nature gives place to a new one, the inferiorto the better? It was therefore quite natural that the Mosaic law, which was in the maingiven for a particular people in a particular age, and suited only their requirements,should give place to a new and universal law, the law of Islåm. The old law had beenpartly forgotten, and what remained was now abrogated to give place to one better andin certain matters one like it. It will thus be seen that the reference here is to the abrogation of the Jewish law, the statement being really an answer to the objection of the JewsThat some of the Quranic verses were abrogated by others, though a generallyaccepted doctrine, is due to a misconception of the words of this verse. The word åyatoccurring here has been wrongly understood to mean a verse of the Qur’ån. Similarwords occur elsewhere: “And when We change a message (åyat) for a message (åyat)— and Allåh knows best what He reveals — they say: Thou art only a forger” (16: 101).This is a Makkan revelation and it is an undisputed fact, admitted by all upholders ofabrogation in the Qur’ån, that there was no abrogation at Makkah, because the details ofthe law were not revealed there. Therefore the word åyat, occurring there twice, couldonly mean a message or a communication from God, and the first message meant theprevious scriptures and by the second message was meant the Qur’ån.The interpretation adopted by the commentators generally is not based on anysaying of the Prophet; it is their own opinion. Nor is there a single report traceable to theProphet that such and such a verse was abrogated. A companion’s opinion that heconsidered a certain verse to have been abrogated by another could not carry the leastweight. It was the Prophet only on whose authority any verse was accepted as being apart of the Holy Qur’ån, and it was he only on whose authority any verse could beconsidered as having been abrogated. But there is not a single √adßth of the Prophetspeaking of abrogation.Another consideration which shows the erroneousness of the doctrine that any verseof the Qur’ån was abrogated by another is the hopeless disagreement of the upholders ofthis view. In the first place there is no agreement as to the number of the verses whichare alleged to have been abrogated; while some accept no more than five verses to beabrogated, others carry the number to hundreds. This shows that the view is based simply on conjecture. Secondly, if one commentator holds a certain verse to be abrogated,another calls this an erroneous view. In Bukhårß especially do we find opposite viewscited side by side. What happened really was this that when a commentator could notreconcile one verse with another, he held the verse to be abrogated by the other, butanother who, giving deeper thought, was able to effect a reconciliation between the two,rejected abrogation. This seems to be the basis on which the theory of abrogation ofQuranic verses rests, and this basis is demolished by the Holy Qur’ån when it says: “Willthey not then meditate on the Qur’ån? And if it were from any other than Allåh, theywould have found in it many a discrepancy” (4: 82). There are no discrepancies in theQur’ån, and it is want of meditation on it that is responsible for the theory of abrogation.\n\n108a. The Jews are addressed here, because it is they who vexed Moses withdifferent demands and different questions. The words whoever adopts disbelief insteadof faith do not signify a change of disbelief for belief, but the adoption of the formerinstead of the latter, and therefore these words also apply to the Jews.\n\n109a. The Jews were so inimical to Islåm that, knowing it to be a religion based onthe Unity of God as their own religion was, and knowing that it led men to a life ofrighteousness and turned them away from the path of evil, they longed, and in fact didtheir best by joining hands with the idolatrous enemies of Islåm, to turn them back intoidolatry. Elsewhere the following words occur about the Jews: “Hast thou not seen thoseto whom a portion of the Book was given? They believe in sorcery and diviners and sayof those who disbelieve: These are better guided in the path than those who believe”(4: 51). The Muslims are, however, told to pardon and forgive.\n\n111a. The address hitherto has been particularly to the Jews, but the “people of theBook” include both Jews and Christians, and along with the idolaters they were bothopposed to Islåm; and hence the Christians are now expressly spoken of. That the Jewsdenounced the Christians and the Christians denounced the Jews is expressly stated in v.113, and hence what is said here may be expanded thus: The Jews say that none shallenter the Garden except a Jew and the Christians say that none shall enter the Gardenexcept the Christians. Both degraded religion to a belief in a set of doctrines, and leading a life of righteousness was not considered as of the essence of religion. \n\n112a. The Jews and the Christians are told that their assertions that only the Jewsand the Christians will be saved are groundless. It is entire submission to Allåh and thedoing of good to His creatures that is the true source of salvation, and that is what Islåm means according to the Holy Qur’ån. Here the word wajh does not stand for the face, butis used “for the whole, because wajh is the most noble part” (LL). Similarly wajhß in3: 20 signifies my person or myself (T). Wajh also means course, way, purpose or objectas in v. 115. From aslama, meaning he submitted himself or entered into peace, is derived thename of the religion which the Holy Qur’ån preaches, i.e., Islåm, for which see 3: 19a.\n\n113a. In ‘alå shai-in the word ‘alå signifies conformity, as in the proverb al-nåsu‘alå dßni mul∂ki-him which means the people are in conformity to, i.e., are followers of,the religion of their kings (LL). The word shai’, which primarily means simply a thing,signifies in such cases a thing worth being regarded, or a thing of any account or value,or anything good, as in the proverb laisa bi-shai’-in (LL).\n\n113b. The Jews and the Christians are here blamed for denying all good in eachother like ignorant men, notwithstanding that they were both followers of one Book, bywhich is here meant the Old Testament, which both accepted. As against this, theQur’ån accepts that there is partial truth in all religions. The declaration of this cosmopolitan principle by Islåm as regards a substratum of truth underlying all religions isthe more wonderful when it is borne in mind that Islåm took its birth in a country whichhad no connection with the outside world, and the principle was proclaimed by a manwho had not read the scriptures of any religion. \n\n114a. The idolatrous Quraish had turned the Muslims out of the Sacred Mosque atMakkah and the Jews and the Christians were now helping them to annihilate the smallMuslim community in Madßnah, which practically meant the laying waste of the SacredMosque itself. The word masåjid (mosques) is used here because the Sacred Mosquewas to be the centre of all the mosques of the world. This generalization further showsthat the fate of all those who prevented Muslims from worshipping Allåh in the mosques is predicted here, and the fate of the opponents of the Prophet bears ample testimony tothe truth of this prediction. The Jewish residents of Madßnah, who exerted themselves totheir utmost to bring ruin to Islåm, were either banished in disgrace or perished in theirstruggle to annihilate Islåm. The idolaters or the Quraish, who prevented Muslims fromrepairing to the Sacred Mosque at Makkah, were also finally subjugated and had to bowtheir heads before the very men whom they had persecuted for no other fault than thatthey worshipped Allåh.\n\n115a. The previous verse predicts disgrace for those who persecuted the Muslims;this one predicts the Muslim conquests by which the enemy was to be disgraced. Theconcluding words, Allåh is Ample-giving, Knowing, also support this conclusion. TheMuslims, who had been deprived of all they possessed and made utterly destitute, werepromised ample gifts. The words whither you turn, thither is Allåh’s purpose, pointclearly to the Divine promise that all obstacles in the path of the Muslims will beremoved and victory will follow their footsteps.The word wajh occurring here denotes countenance or face, as well as course, purpose, or object which one is pursuing, or a direction in which one is going or looking (T,LL). According to R it signifies attention or course. \n\n116a. The Christian doctrine that God has a son is refuted here. Though mainly it isthe Jews who are addressed in this chapter, Christianity also is spoken of occasionally,in contrast with the next chapter in which Christianity finds a detailed mention whilethere are occasional references to Judaism. The phrase sub√åna-h∂ is always used todeclare the freedom of the Divine Being from all imperfections, and is alwaysmentioned in connection with the doctrine of sonship to show that to attribute a son tothe Divine Being is to attribute an imperfection to Him, which is met with in humanbeings. The doctrine of sonship is mentioned here as being opposed to the religionwhich requires entire submission to Divine commandments from every man and thusdispenses with the necessity of a conciliator. \n\n117a. The original word is Badß‘, which is applicable to the thing made as well as tothe maker. A thing is badß‘ which is not after the similitude of any thing pre-existing,and badß‘ is also the person who makes or produces or brings into existence for the firsttime and not after the similitude of anything pre-existing (LL). \n\n117b. Kun fa-yak∂nu is the oft-recurring phrase in which Allåh’s act of the creationand annihilation of things is spoken of in the Holy Qur’ån. It is not meant by this that there is no gradual process in the creation of things; evolution in creation is in fact plainlyspoken of in the very first words of the Qur’ån, where God is spoken of as Rabb(Evolver) of worlds, the Fosterer of a thing in such a manner as to make it attain onecondition after another until it reaches its goal of completion (R). It is, in fact, an answerto those who think that the creation of things by God is dependent on the previous existence of matter and soul and the adaptability of their attributes. The argument given herein the word badß‘ is that man, who stands in need of matter to make things, also stands inneed of a pattern after which to make them, but God stands in need of neither. The verseseems particularly to refer here, however, to the revolution that was to be brought aboutby the Prophet. It seemed an impossibility to men, but Allåh had decreed it. And, in fact,the revolution brought about in Arabia by the Prophet was so wonderful that the oldheaven and earth of the peninsula may be said to have been changed into new ones.\n\n118a. The disbelievers refused to accept the truth of Islåm unless either Allåh spoketo them, so that they should have a proof that He sends His messages to men, or that asign should come to them. The sign which they often demanded was the threatenedpunishment. As disgrace in this world is predicted for them (v. 114), their demand is thatas an evidence of the Prophet’s truth that punishment should overtake them. The answerto both these demands is contained in v. 119, for as a bearer of good news the Prophettold them that if they purified themselves by walking in his footsteps, Allåh would speakto them, and as a warner he informed them of the coming wrath if they persisted in theirevil ways. \n\n120a. The Guidance of Allåh or the religion of Islåm is here called al-hudå or theperfect guidance, as against the Jewish and Christian religions which are called ahwå’ahum or their desires, because both the religions had lost their original purity. What the Prophet taught is here called al-‘ilm, or science, because it establishes all the principlesof religion, both theoretical and practical, with clearness.\n\n121a. The Muslims are meant, while the Book is the Qur’ån (AH). I‘Ab interpretsthe words yatl∂na-h∂ ƒaqqa tilåwati-hß as meaning follow it as it ought to be followed(IJ). For talå, meaning he followed it, or did according to it, see LL, which quotesseveral authorities.\n\n122a. The Israelites are thrice told in the Holy Qur’ån that God had made them agreat nation but that it was by their own evil deeds and forsaking the ways of righteousness that they were proving themselves unworthy of that greatness. They are firstaddressed in v. 40 and told that the Prophet Mu√ammad came in fulfilment of their ownprophecies. They are again addressed in v. 47 and told how favours were shown to themin the time of Moses and after him. Now they are being addressed a third time andreminded of the covenant which was made with Abraham, the great patriarch in whomthe Israelites and the Ishmaelites met. \n\n124a. The first part of the verse relates that Abraham was made spiritual leader ofmen because he was found perfect in fulfilling the Divine commandments. As a spiritualleader of three great nations of the world, that patriarch occupies a unique position among religious personalities. Having discussed at length that a prophet from theIshmaelites had come in accordance with the prophecies of the Israelite prophets, theHoly Qur’ån now proceeds to show that even the covenant with their great ancestorAbraham necessitated the appearance of a prophet in Arabia.The second part of the verse states that the spiritual leadership of the world was stillwith Abraham’s descendants. They are told that the covenant was made, not with Israelbut with Abraham, and that therefore the seed of Ishmael and Isaac were equally to beblessed. Nay, as stated further on in v. 125, the covenant was made with both Abrahamand Ishmael. The Jewish and Christian contention that the covenant made with Ishmaelwas simply of a temporal nature is groundless. On the other hand, the followingarguments show that the covenant included both Ishmael and Isaac. (1) The promise tobless Abraham and his seed was given long before either Ishmael or Isaac was born:“And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great;and thou shalt be a blessing. ... And in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed”(Gen. 12: 2,      3). (2) The promise given to Abraham regarding the multiplicity of his seedis the same as that given to Hagar regarding Ishmael when she conceived him: “And Hebrought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thoube able to number them: and He said unto him, So shall thy seed be” (Gen. 15: 5). “Andthe angel of the Lord said unto her (i.e. Hagar), I will multiply thy seed exceedingly, thatit shall not be numbered for multitude” (Gen. 16: 10). (3) The covenant was made againwith Abraham after Ishmael was born, while Abraham had no hope of another son, norwas there a Divine promise that a son should be born to him from Sårah, the promisecontained in Gen. 15: 4, “but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall bethine heir” having been fulfilled in the birth of Ishmael. This promise is contained inGen. 17: 2–6: “And I will make My covenant between Me and thee, and will multiplythee exceedingly. ... And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations ofthee, and kings shall come out of thee”. (4) The covenant was renewed with Ishmaelafter Isaac was promised: “And as for Ishmael I have heard thee: Behold I have blessedhim, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shallhe beget, and I will make him a great nation” (Gen. 17: 20). It should also be noted thatGod’s hearing Abraham with regard to Ishmael refers to Abraham’s prayer in Gen.17: 18: “O that Ishmael might live before thee!”, and shows that Ishmael was righteousin the sight of God. (5) The nature of the promise made to Ishmael does not differmaterially from that made to Abraham: they are both to be blessed, both to be madefruitful, the seed of both is to be multiplied exceedingly, princes and kings are promisedamong the descendants of both of them, and both are promised to be made a greatnation. Nothing is said regarding Abraham that is not said regarding Ishmael. (6) Thecovenant on the part of Abraham’s seed was kept by the children of Isaac as well as ofIshmael. According to Gen. 17: 10: “This is My covenant which ye shall keep betweenMe and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised”.Now, circumcision has been a characteristic of the Israelites as well as of theIshmaelites. Hence God’s covenant was with both these nations. (7) The fulfilment ofthe covenant on the part of God has also been true with regard to both nations: “And Iwill give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land wherein thou art a stranger, allthe land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God” (Gen. 17: 8).If the covenant was only with Isaac’s children, the promise of an everlasting possessionfailed with the advent of Islåm, so that even God could not keep His promise. But thefact is that the land of Canaan continues to remain as an everlasting possession in thehands of the seed of Abraham, for as soon as the Israelites or their representatives, theChristians, were deemed unfit to have the Holy Land in their possession because of theirunrighteousness, that Holy Land was given to the Arabs, who were Ishmaelites, and to this day it remains in the hands of the Muslims, who are the true representatives of thehouse of Ishmael.\n\n125a. Al-Bait or The House is the famous house known by this name to this day, theKa‘bah. It is also known as Bait Allåh or the House of Allåh, and is the same as the Bethel of the Bible. In the Qur’ån itself it is mentioned by the name al-Bait several times, ashere and in vv. 127,      158; 3: 97; 8: 35; 22:26. It is also mentioned as al-Bait al-Ïaråm orthe Sacred House (5: 2,      97), and al-Bait al-‘Atßq, or the Ancient House (22: 29,      33), andal-Bait al-Ma‘m∂r or the Oft-visited House (52: 4). It is also spoken of as awwala bait-inwu˙i‘a li-l-nåsi, the First House appointed for men for Divine worship (3: 96).History bears out these three distinguishing characteristics of the Ka‘bah. It existsfrom the remotest antiquity; it was visited annually by people from the most distantcorners of Arabia; and its sacredness was respected by the whole of Arabia. Thus writesMuir: “A very high antiquity must be assigned to the main features of the religion ofMecca. ... Diodorus Siculus, writing about half a century before our era, says of Arabiawashed by the Red Sea: “There is in this country a temple greatly revered by the Arabs”.These words must refer to the Holy House of Mecca, for we know of no other whichever commanded such universal homage. ... Tradition represents the Ka‘bah as fromtime immemorial the scene of pilgrimage from all quarters of Arabia: from Yemen andHa˙ramaut, from the shores of the Persian Gulf, the deserts of Syria, and the distantenvirons of Hira and Mesopotamia, men yearly flocked to Mecca. So extensive ahomage must have had its beginnings in an extremely remote age” (Life of Mahomet).\n\n125b. The previous verse speaks of Abraham, and there is apparently a change nowintroduced in resorting to the subject of the Ka‘bah. But really there is no change. Thissection deals with the covenant made with Abraham and this covenant included both theIsraelites and the Ishmaelites. The Ka‘bah, the spiritual centre of Islåm, it is now related,was connected with the name of Abraham, and pointed reference to this is made in themention of Maqåm Ibråhßm or the Place of Abraham. It is true that a particular place, asmall building supported by six pillars about eight feet high, situated in the Ka‘bah, isknown by this name, and was so known in the time of the Prophet and even before him,and this is incontrovertible evidence of Abraham’s connection with Arabia and itsspiritual centre. But here really Maqåm Ibråhßm stands for the House itself. It is TheHouse that was made a resort for men and a place of security as stated in the openingwords of the verse, and it is The House that was to be purified of idols by Abraham andIshmael, as stated in the latter part. The injunction therefore to take the Place ofAbraham for a place of prayer can carry no other significance than that The House or theKa‘bah shall be the Central Mosque of the Muslims. It is called the Place of Abrahambecause it was Abraham who purified it of the idols and it was Abraham who rebuilt TheHouse as stated further on. While some commentators take the words Maqåm Ibråhßmas referring to the particular place known by that name, many of them understand by itthe Ka‘bah or the whole of the sanctuary. There is a √adßth in Bukhårß according towhich ‘Umar is reported to have said to the Prophet: O Messenger of Allåh, wert thou totake Maqåm Ibråhßm for a place of prayer. These words were spoken when the Prophet,after his flight to Madßnah, turned his face to Jerusalem as the qiblah, because Jerusalemwas the qiblah of the Israelite prophets that had gone before him. It was on receivingthis Divine injunction that he made the Ka‘bah the qiblah of the Muslims. \n\n 125c. It should be noted that Ishmael is very often mentioned along with Abrahamin connection with the Ka‘bah. Ishmael’s connection with Arabia is established by theBible itself, for Kedar (son of Ishmael, Gen. 25: 13) stands throughout the writings of theOld Testament for Arabia (Ps. 120: 5; Is. 42: 11; 60: 7). The Arab tradition on this pointwas so strong and of such old standing that the Holy Qur’ån every now and then refersto it as a matter of undoubted history. As Muir says: “This was no Muslim fiction, butthe popular opinion of the Meccans long before the era of Mu√ammad, otherwise itcould not have been referred to in the Qur’ån as an acknowledged fact, nor would thenames of certain spots around the Ka‘bah have been connected, as we know them tohave been, with Abraham and Ishmael” (Life of Mahomet). The Arab tradition representing Abraham as coming with Hagar and Ishmael to the place where now Makkah is, isquite independent of the Bible statement, and the two taken together justify us indrawing the conclusion as to the truth of the Quranic statement. Moreover, the situationof Makkah on a well-recognized ancient route from Syria to Yaman and the visits fromthe deserts of Syria to that “Ancient House” corroborate this conclusion. Thus there isnot the least reason to reject the popular tradition as a fable, and the facts recorded in theQur’ån are borne out fully by Arab tradition and the Bible.References to Ishmael, the eldest son of Abraham, are very frequent in the HolyQur’ån. For further references see 2: 133,      136,      140; 3: 84; 4: 163; 6: 86; 14: 39; 19: 54,      55;21: 85; 37: 101–107 (where he is not mentioned by name); and 38:48.For references to Isaac, Abraham’s younger son, which are always brief, see 2: 133,      136,      140; 3: 84; 4: 163; 6: 84; 11: 71; 12: 6; 14: 39; 19: 49; 21: 72; 29: 27; 37: 112,      113; and38: 45–47. \n\n126a. It was Abraham who, when settling Hagar and Ishmael near the SacredHouse, which was already there, laid the foundations of a city there. Makkah iselsewhere spoken of as hådh-al-Balad (14: 35; 90: 1,      2) or this City. In 3: 96, it ismentioned by the name Bakkah. It was built in a place which was unproductive of fruit(14: 37) and therefore devoid of the primal necessities of life. Hence, Abraham’s prayerfor the residents of the city that they might be provided with fruits. But while Abrahamprayed for provisions of life for the righteous only, God’s acceptance of the prayerincluded the wicked as well. Elsewhere, the acceptance of this prayer is referred to thus:“Have We not settled them in a safe, sacred territory to which fruits of every kind aredrawn? A sustenance from Us” (28: 57).\n\n127a. Abraham and Ishmael rebuilt the Ka‘bah, which was already there; see 14:37.\n\n128a. The word translated as submissive is Muslim in the original. A Muslim is socalled because he surrenders himself to the will of God or because he is secure from theslavery of the devil (R) or because he enters into peace. Though all prophets wereMuslims, only the followers of the Prophet Mu√ammad are known as a Muslim nation.At the time when these verses were revealed, there existed only a few Muslims inMadßnah, and reference to a Muslim nation was still prophetical.\n\n129a. The Messenger had appeared but the great task of teaching the Book and theWisdom to the progeny of Ishmael, the Arabs, and the still greater task of purifyingthem of evil, had yet to be performed, and its mention at this time was therefore prophetical. The more one ponders on the unique transformation brought about by the Prophetin Arabia, and through Arabia in the world, the more his head bows before the grandeurof this prophecy. \n\n130a. I©Δafainå-hu means We made him pure from all dross (AH); also We chosehim (LL). The root is ©afw meaning purity. Mu©Δafå, the Purified One or the ChosenOne, is one of the titles of our Prophet. \n\n132a. Jacob, elsewhere called Israel, was the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham.Compare Gen. 18: 19: “For I know him, that he will command his children and hishousehold after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord, to do justice and judgement.”For further references to Jacob, see 2: 133,      136,      140; 3: 84,      92; 4: 163; 6: 84; 12thchapter; 21: 72,      73; and 38: 45–47. \n\n135a. Ïanßf is from the root √anf, meaning inclining or declining (LL). Hence √anßfis one inclining to a right state or tendency (R, LL). The word is often mentioned inconnection with the name of Abraham and the Holy Prophet, and his followers are alsoenjoined to be √anßf. It seems to signify firmness in sticking to the right state, and has,no doubt, reference to the inclining to error on the part of both the Jews and theChristians. As opposed to both these professed followers of Abraham, the Muslims areenjoined to remain firm in the right state, and thus to be the true representatives of theAbrahamic faith in the world. It is for this reason that the word √anßf is used here inopposition to the attitude of both the Jews and the Christians.\n\n136a. This shows the cosmopolitan nature of a Muslim’s belief. Not only is belief inthe great prophets of Israel an article of faith with a Muslim, but the words that whichwas given to the prophets from their Lord make the Muslim conception of belief inprophets as wide as the world. And it should be noted that this broad conception waspromulgated at a time when the Jews and the Christians were exerting themselves to theutmost against the new faith. \n\n137a. Islåm recognized the prophets of the Jews and the Christians and the prophetsof all other nations. How could a follower of any religion reject Islåm? Yet the Jews notonly did not accept Islåm, but actively opposed it, so much so that they were makingplans to take the Prophet’s life and annihilate a religion which was based on such broadprinciples. The words Allåh will suffice thee against them mean that Allåh will guardthee against their evil plans to annihilate thee (AH).\n\n138a. ˝abgh means dyeing or colouring, and also dipping or immersing in water;hence ©ibghah indicates baptism, which the Christians effect by immersing in water.˝ibghah also means religion (T), because religion brings about a change in mentalityand gives its own colour to a man’s views. The religion of Islåm is called Allåh’s colourbecause God is uppermost in a Muslim’s ideas, and because his views are as broad ashumanity. This particular word ©ibghah has also been adopted here as a hint to theChristians that the baptism of water does not effect any change in a man. It is thebaptism of the broad principle of faith, accepting the prophets of all nations, that bringsabout change in the mentality of man. It is through this baptism that the new birth isreceived, because it opens the mind for the reception of all truth, and inspires it withlove and reverence for all good men. \n\n139a. A Muslim’s conception of Allåh is very broad. It includes all that is best in allother religions, but is free from the limitations they put. Therefore no one who is true tohis religion can dispute the Muslim conception of the Divine Being. Moreover, everyreligion of the world limits the spiritual sustenance of God to one nation or one country.A Jew thinks that God revealed truth only to the Israelites; a Christian thinks that thetruth was revealed only to Jesus; a Hindu thinks that God revealed the truth only to thesages of India; a Zoroastrian thinks that the truth was revealed to none but Zoroaster.Not so Islåm, which says that the truth was revealed to every nation. Every nation thusaccepts partial truth, only that part of the truth which was revealed to it, but Islåmaccepts the whole truth.\n\n140a. The interrogation here is simply to reprove the Jews and the Christians, forthe Jewish claim was that only acceptance of the Jewish law could save man, and theChristians claimed that none could be saved unless he accepted the atonement of Jesus.They are told that their ancestors who were prophets were the followers of neither theone nor the other. Islåm was, in fact, a reversion to the simple faith of sincerity, the faithof Abraham and his immediate followers and descendants. \n\n142a. Qiblah means the direction or point towards which one turns his face (LL). Inits religious usage it means the direction towards which one turns his face when saying his prayers, and the qiblah is thus the Spiritual Centre of a people. The change herereferred to is the change which took place at Madßnah about sixteen months after theProphet’s flight to that city (B. 2: 29). It should be noted that while the Holy Prophet wasat Makkah among the idolaters of Arabia, he used to pray with his face to the HolyTemple at Jerusalem, but when he came to Madßnah, where the Jewish element wasstrong and powerful, he was directed by Divine Revelation to turn his face to the Ka‘bahas his qiblah. The Jews are here spoken of in particular, and the subject continues whatis said in the last two sections. If Abraham’s seed was to be blessed in Ishmael’sprogeny, it was necessary that the new Spiritual Centre should be the house purified byAbraham and Ishmael, the First House appointed for men, the temple at Jerusalem beingonly the spiritual centre of the Israelites. This change contained a clear indication thatMakkah would be conquered by the Muslims, for, an idolatrous temple could not be thespiritual centre of a religion of pure monotheism. To this conquest of Makkah there isalso a reference in the words, “The East and the West belong only to Allåh”.\n\n143a. The word in the original is wasaΔ, which signifies the middle part of anything;and therefore, as being removed from either extreme, it signifies the best part of a thing,according to LL, who translates ummat wasaΔ as meaning a just, equitable or goodnation; that is, one not inclining to either extreme. The commentators explain wasaΔ asmeaning equitable and exalted (Rz, AH, Kf), and this sense fits the context. By makingthe Ka‘bah their qiblah, Allåh had made it known that they were the people, the Muslimnation, for whom Abraham had prayed (v. 128), and therefore they were the inheritors ofall those Divine blessings which had been promised to the seed of Abraham. \n\n143b. One explanation of shahßd, or bearer of witness, is given in the followingwords: “So that you may carry to them what you have learned of the revelation and thefaith as Allåh’s Messenger has brought to you” (AH, Rz). Therefore the bearers ofwitness are the persons who carry knowledge to others, bearing testimony to its truth intheir own persons. Some commentators explain the word as meaning a purifier (AH).But shahßd also signifies one possessing much knowledge (LL), and it means also anImåm or a leader, and the significance is that just as the Prophet delivered the messageof truth to the Muslims and was their purifier and leader, the role of the Muslimcommunity was to deliver the message of truth to the whole of humanity and to be itspurifiers and leaders. \n\n143c. Rz explains the words kunta ‘alai-hå as meaning on which thou hadst firmlyset thy heart that it should be thy qiblah. It thus appears that the Prophet longed that theKa‘bah should be his qiblah, yet he did not take any step until he had received theDivine Revelation. If his revelations had been the outcome of his own desires he wouldnot have waited for sixteen months for a revelation from on high to change the qiblah. \n\n143d. Na‘lama means We might know; but I have followed AH in translating it asmeaning We might distinguish, for ‘ilm is not followed by min except when it is used inthe sense of distinguishing one thing from another. Taking the ordinary meaning, thesignificance would be that God might know how they act when confronted with the test. \n\n143e. By some the word ßmån, lit., faith, is explained as meaning prayer (I‘Ab-B).Adopting the ordinary significance, the words would mean that the faithful had no hesitation in accepting the change, and thus their faith bore fruit by keeping them on theright path. \n\n144a. The words fa-la-nuwalliyanna-ka qiblat-an are generally translated as Weshall turn thee to a qiblah. But the order to make the Ka‘bah a qiblah had already beengiven, see v. 125; and this section deals with the objections arising from this change, asvv. 142 and 143 show. One of the objections the Jews advanced was that while theProphet claimed that his religion was the religion of pure monotheism, he made theKa‘bah, which was full of idols, his Spiritual Centre; see 142a. The Prophet turned hisface to heaven, i.e., sought help from God in this matter, and the words that follow arean answer to this prayer, and could not mean We shall turn thee to a qiblah, because thathad already been done. He is here told that the Ka‘bah will not remain an idol temple, ashe will soon be master of it, and idolatry will forever be swept off from the newSpiritual Centre of the world. The words wallå kadhå mean he made him guardian orpossessor of a thing (R), as walß means a guardian, and wilåyat means government ormanagement of a Province, and wallå (inf.n. tauliyah) means he set anyone over,entrusted anyone with the government of a Province or management of an affair (R).Wallå when followed by ‘an, as in v. 142, means he turned him back from a thing, butwhen followed by two objects, as here, it means he made him master of a thing. So theProphet was told to have no anxiety on that account and to turn his face to the Ka‘bah. \n\n144b. The truth of the Prophet was manifest so far as the Jews and the Christianswere concerned. There was a clear prophecy for the appearance of a Prophet who was tobe the like of Moses; see Deut. 18: 15–18. That Prophet was to appear from among the“brethren” of the Israelites, i.e., the Ishmaelites, and not a single prophet from amongthe Israelites, not even Jesus, claimed to be the promised prophet of Deut. They alsoknew that God had promised to bless Ishmael (see 124a), but that no prophet had up tothis time appeared from among the Ishmaelites. They also knew that Ishmael was left inArabia, and they identified his son, Kedar, with the Arabs. Isaiah 21: 13 speaks in clearwords of a prophecy about “Arabia” and of the Prophet’s Flight. The Bait Allåh(Ka‘bah) was the only Beit-el that the world knew. \n\n145a. Every sign of the Prophet’s truth had been given to them already but theirhearts were so hardened that they did not pay any attention to the clearest signs. Butthey were not agreed even among themselves. Notwithstanding that the Jews andChristians both looked to the temple at Jerusalem as their central temple, they were notagreed upon it as their qiblah or Spiritual Centre. The Christians turned towards the East(Muir). Moreover, there are differences among the Jews and the Samaritans, though bothfollow the law of Moses. \n\n146a. All the prophets of Abraham’s seed had hitherto appeared among theChildren of Israel, and hence as they know their sons is equivalent to as they know theIsraelite prophets, the significance of the whole passage being that the Israelites or theJews recognized the Prophet who appeared among the Children of Ishmael, as theyrecognized the prophets who appeared among the Children of Israel. They knew this notonly because blessings had equally been promised for both sons of Abraham, but alsobecause of the clear prophecy of Moses that a prophet like him would be raised amongthe brethren of the Israelites, i.e., Ishmaelites, and because no prophet answering thatdescription had appeared among the Israelites. \n\n148a. In making the Ka‘bah the Spiritual Centre the Muslims are told that theirgoal, as a nation, is to lead the world on to the greatest good. Their race is not a race formaterial benefits, a race for riches or power, but a race for the attainment of good and forthe spread of good. As stated in clear words in v. 143, they are made leaders of theworld, and this lead they are now told they must give in doing good, and hence theymust vie with one another in doing good. In the words that follow — wherever you areAllåh will bring you all together — they are told that they will be spread far and wide inthe world, yet their goal must be one. The outward unity of the qiblah has a deepermeaning under it; it stands for their unity of purpose, as being a nation which strivesafter one goal, and it forms the basis on which rests the brotherhood of Islåm; hence thesaying of the Prophet: “Do not call those who follow your qiblah unbelievers” (N. underKufr). \n\n149a. A great honour is thus given to the Sacred Mosque but it must be rememberedthat the Ka‘bah has never been supposed by any Muslim to possess any Divine attribute.The strange conclusion drawn by some Christian writers, that the honour thus given tothe Ka‘bah is a remnant of the pre-Islåmic Arab polytheism or idolatry, is quiteerroneous. The Muslims honour the Ka‘bah because it is their Spiritual Centre; they donot worship it. Even the idolatrous Arabs never worshipped the Ka‘bah, though they hadplaced idols in it which they worshipped.It should also be borne in mind that the famous Black Stone was not one of the Arabidols, nor can the kissing of it in performing the pilgrimage be looked upon as a remnantof idolatry. That Stone stands only as a monument: “The stone which the buildersrefused is become the head-stone of the corner” (Ps. 118: 22). Ishmael was looked uponas rejected, and the covenant was considered to have been made with the children ofIsaac, yet it was that rejected stone, for which the Black Stone at the Ka‘bah stands as amonument, that was to become “the head-stone of the corner”. The Black Stone isunhewn, so it is the stone that was “cut out of the mountain without hands” (Dan. 2: 45).Jesus Christ made this clear in the parable of the husbandmen, when he plainly told theIsraelites that the vineyard (i.e., the kingdom of God) would be taken away from themand given to “other husbandmen”, i.e. to a non-Israelite people, giving indication of thatpeople in the words: “Did ye never read in the Scriptures, The stone which the buildersrejected, the same is become the head of the corner?” (Matt. 21: 42). And he added: “Thekingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruitsthereof ” (Matt. 21: 43), thus showing that he was referring to a rejected nation. Hence ifthe Black Stone is kissed, it is not kissed as an idol or as a god, but as a monument ofthe rejection of a nation which was to become the corner-stone of the Divine kingdom. \n\n150a. By completing of favour is meant the bestowing of spiritual favours onthem. The Muslim nation was not like any other nation of the world, nor was mereadvancement in the world their goal. The words with which the next verse opens are afurther explanation: “Even as We have sent among you a Messenger from among you,who recites to you Our messages and purifies you”. They are thus told that they havebeen raised to carry the Divine message to other people and to purify them and teachthem the Book and the Wisdom. Spiritual light was henceforth to shine from oneSpiritual Centre alone. If that message was not conveyed to other people they had a pleaagainst the Muslims that they had not conveyed the Truth to them. The turning of theface to the Sacred Mosque is thus equivalent to proclaiming the Truth which had itsorigin in the Ka‘bah to the whole world. If the Muslims did not do it, they failed in theirduty to God and man.The Prophet and his followers are told in this verse that with the change ofprophethood from the Israelites to the Ishmaelites it was necessary to change the SpiritualCentre too, so that people may have no plea against you. The Ka‘bah was the house rebuiltby Abraham and Ishmael, and with prophethood now being transferred to the descendantsof Ishmael, the Spiritual Centre had necessarily to be changed. The Ka‘bah was moreoverthe first Spiritual Centre of the world (3: 96), and it was in the fitness of things that itshould be the last Spiritual Centre of the whole world. The words of the next verse whichspeak of the Messenger in almost the same words as the Messenger of Abraham’s prayerin v. 129 make this significance still more clear. In the completion of favours in theconcluding words of the verse there is a reference to the Muslim nation being the exaltednation of v. 143 whose sole object was to carry the truth to the whole world. \n\n151a. The reference is to Abraham’s prayer in v. 129, as pointed out in the last note.The functions of the Promised Prophet there are exactly the same as here. \n\n152a. The opening words of the verse fa-dhkur∂-nß adhkur-kum may be translatedeither as remember Me I will remember you or as glorify Me I will make you eminent,for the word dhikr carries either significance, remembrance or honouring. Adoptingeither significance, what is stated here is that if the Muslims keep God in the forefront oftheir programme, they will be made great as a nation.\n\n153a. The Sacred Mosque at Makkah was in the possession of the idolaters, but bymaking it the qiblah of the Muslims promise was given to them that it would soon betheirs, purified of idol-worship. But to attain this great object they must seek Divineassistance, which would be granted them if they faced hardships with perseverance andkept up praying to God. There is, however, a deeper reference in these words to theMuslims’ duty to proclaim the great spiritual Truth, with which they had been favoured,to the whole world. This was a work which could only be done with Divine help, andthis they were required to seek through perseverance and prayer.\n\n154a. The sacrifice of life which must be undertaken in the cause of Truth is hintedat in this passage. The words f ß sabßl Allåh, frequently occurring in the Holy Qur’ån,rendered literally in the way of Allåh or in the cause of Allåh, signify the cause of Truth.That the cause of the Muslims is really the cause of truth, right and justice, and that theywere compelled to fight to defend the Truth has been discussed in various places.Sale’s comment that the words f ß sabßl Allåh always “meant war undertaken againstunbelievers for the propagation of the Muhammadan faith” is baseless. Carrying themessage of Islåm to non-Muslims is indeed the duty of a Muslim, and anyone engagedin this work is undoubtedly working in the way of Allåh, but that a Muslim was requiredto carry the message of God at the point of the sword is no more than a myth. \n\n155a. The Muslims had already made great sacrifices in the cause of Allåh. Theyhad left their homes, their near and dear ones and everything they had, behind them atMakkah, and had come to Madßnah empty-handed, but they were now told that theywould have to make more sacrifices yet. They would have to face fear and hunger and all kinds of losses, even death itself. If they bore all these sufferings with steadfastness,they would have a great future, of which the good news is given to them beforehand.That those who sacrifice their lives in the cause of Truth never die is a truth which isgenerally recognized. As truth lives and falsehood must die, so those who make thetriumph of Truth the object of their lives do not die, even though they are slain in thecause of Truth. Or those who have sacrificed their lives in the cause of Truth gain thelife eternal, while the dead are really those who are dead in ignorance. \n\n156a. This is the true expression of a Muslim’s resignation under trials: We areAllåh’s and to Him we shall return. He resigns himself to the will of God so thoroughlythat no trial or misfortune can disturb the course of his life, which has a much higher goalbefore it than mere comfort. Come what may, the contentment of his mind is never lost. \n\n158a. The ˝afå and the Marwah are two mountains near Makkah. They were thescene of Hagar’s running to and fro in quest of water when left alone with Ishmael in thewilderness. These two mountains now serve as two monuments of the reward whichpatience brought, and it is as a memorial to Hagar’s patience that they are now goneround by the pilgrims. \n\n158b. On the ˝afå was an idol called Usåf, and on the Marwah one called Nå’ilah,which the pilgrims touched in the days of ignorance, and hence the apprehensions of theMuslims in going round them (IJ). “The people of Madßnah were averse to going roundthe ˝afå and the Marwah”, though no reason for their aversion is given (B. 65: ii,      21).The concluding portion of the verse again generalizes the subject. The suffering which aman has to endure in the doing of good is not left unrewarded, for Allåh is Bountiful inrewarding. In these words the Muslims are in fact exhorted to prepare themselves forenduring sufferings to establish Truth, being at the same time told that they will beamply rewarded for their sacrifices.\n\n159a. As against those who willingly endure all kinds of sufferings in the cause oftruth, the Qur’ån now speaks of people who hide the truth, i.e., they neither act according to it, nor do they carry the message to others. Though speaking of the Jews, thewords convey a warning to the Muslims.For the meaning of la‘nat, or curse, see 88b. The reference in those who curse seemsto be to Moses and the Israelite prophets: “But it shall come to pass, if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God, to observe to do all His commandments and Hisstatutes which I command thee this day, that all these curses shall come upon thee andovertake thee: cursed shalt thou be in the city and cursed shalt thou be in the field, cursedshall be thy basket and thy store. Cursed shall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thyland, the increase of thy kine and the flocks of thy sheep. Cursed shalt thou be when thoucomest in, and cursed shalt thou be when thou goest out” (Deut. 28: 15–19). After enumerating the curses of the Lord, His sending upon them “cursing, vexation, and rebuke”,His making the pestilence “cleave” to them, His smiting them with “a consumption, andwith a fever, and with an inflammation, and with an extreme burning, and with the sword,and with blasting ... and the botch of Egypt ... and madness and blindness”, the curses ofmen are thus spoken of: “Thou shalt go out one way against them and flee seven waysbefore them”, “thou shalt be only oppressed and spoiled evermore”, “thou shalt betroth awife, and another man shall lie with her: thou shalt build a house, and thou shalt not dwelltherein”, “thy sons and thy daughters shall be given unto another people ... the fruit of thyland and all thy labours shall a nation which thou knowest not eat up; and thou shalt beonly oppressed and crushed always” (Deut. 28: 20–68). \n\n161a. This verse continues the subject-matter of v. 159, the disbelievers spoken ofhere being those who hide the truth. The curse of God stands for their estrangementfrom God, the curse of the angels signifies their loss of all incentive to good and nobledeeds, and the curse of men signifies their subjugation to other people. \n\n163a. The mention of Divine Unity in this, the concluding verse of the section, is toshow that it was for this object that the trials and privations spoken of in this section were to be undergone. The ultimate triumph of Divine Unity is spoken of in the nextsection. \n\n164a. The unity of Allåh is declared by the whole of nature, and being such a cleardoctrine, must no doubt at last prevail over idolatry and polytheism of every kind. Notonly did Arabia witness the truth of this thirteen hundred years ago, but even today wesee that, as man is freed from the trammels of prejudice, he realizes the truth of DivineUnity more and more. The uniformity that is clearly observed in the diversity of natureis constantly appealed to in the Qur’ån as a sign of the Unity of the Maker. \n\n165a. The objects of worship here referred to may include idols, but the reference isapparently to the leaders who lead their followers into evil. This is made plain by theverses that follow, where “those who were followed”, i.e. the leaders, renounce thosewho followed them.\n\n165b. While Allåh’s love for His creatures is the ever-recurring theme that findsexpression in the Holy Qur’ån, the believer’s love for Allåh, or absolute submissionto the Divine Being, is here declared to be stronger than all other ties of love andfriendship, including that which unites a man to his idols or other false deities. \n\n167a. The mutual renouncement of the leaders and their followers takes place sometimes in this very life. It should also be noted that it is the intense regret for the evildeeds done, here described as being the Fire, from which there is no escape. \n\n168a. The fundamental principle of faith, Divine Unity, having been discussed atfull length, certain secondary rules and regulations are now considered, and among thesethe subject of prohibited foods is introduced first with a twofold object. In the first placeit enjoins that only lawful and good things should be eaten. The lawful things are notonly those which the law has not declared to be forbidden, but even unforbidden thingsbecome unlawful if they are acquired unlawfully, by theft, robbery, cheating, bribery,etc. The Israelites stood in special need of being reminded of this, for while they laid toomuch stress upon the ceremonies of religion, they were utterly indifferent to internalpurity, and they would make a show of utter abhorrence to forbidden things but gladlydevoured what was unlawfully acquired, a practice of which they are elsewherecondemned in plain words: “Why do not the rabbis and the doctors of law prohibit themfrom their sinful utterances and their devouring unlawful gain?” (5: 63).Secondly, by adding the injunction follow not the footsteps of the devil, the realobject of the prohibition is made plain. The Holy Qur’ån recognizes some sort ofrelation between the physical and the spiritual conditions of man. There is not the leastdoubt that food plays an important part in the formation of character, and the heart andthe brain powers are clearly affected by the quality of food. The same law is seenworking in the whole of the animal kingdom. As the Holy Qur’ån is meant for all stagesof the development of human society, it contains rules and regulations for the bettermentof the physical as well as the moral and the spiritual conditions of man.\n\n171a. The Prophet is likened to the crier who calls out, but the disbelievers are deafto reason, and are like cattle which only hear the cry of the driver, but do not understandthe meaning of what he says. This is in accordance with what is said in the previousverse. Some commentators are of the opinion that the crier is the disbeliever, who criesfor help or guidance to his false gods, who do not know what he says. But these falsegods do not hear even the cry, and hence the words cannot apply to them. \n\n172a. The injunction to eat of the good things is directed against the use of thingswhich are injurious to health, though they may not be forbidden by law. \n\n173a. That which dies of itself and that which was torn by beasts was forbidden bythe law of Moses also (Lev. 17: 15); so was blood (Lev. 7: 26); and the flesh of swine(Lev. 11: 7). The Jews held the swine in great detestation, and the mention of the animalin the Gospels shows that Jesus Christ held it in equal abhorrence, which proves that hetoo regarded the animal as impure. Neither does he appear to have broken the Jewishlaw in this respect.The commentators are of the opinion that the reference in that over which any othername than that of Allåh has been invoked is to the animals slaughtered by the worshippers of idols, which they used to slaughter as offerings to their idols (Rz), or to that overwhich the name of an idol is invoked at the time of its slaughter (Bd), for among theArabs the practice was that animals were slaughtered in the name of an idol. But thestatement made in the Holy Qur’ån is general, and the invocation of any name other thanthat of Allåh makes the animal slaughtered unlawful. \n\n173b. Ghaira bågh-in signifies not desiring to eat it for the sake of enjoyment, lå‘åd-in means not exceeding the bare limit of want. \n\n174a. The physical and the spiritual are beautifully welded together in the HolyQur’ån. The prohibition to eat certain impure or injurious foods is followed by awarning against the eating of fire, and thus the connection is established. Caution isalways given lest too much stress should be laid upon the outward ceremonial of thelaw. Here we are told that even more dangerous than the prohibited foods is the eating offire, which means the concealing of what is revealed in the Book. The concealment inthis case means not acting upon the teaching of the Book. Though the Jews may serve asan example, the Muslims are equally warned of the danger of being strict in external actsof purity while neglecting internal purity.\n\n 176a. By those who disagree about the Book are meant people who accept one partof the Divine Revelation and reject the other, as the Jews and the Christians did, theBook in this case standing for the whole of the Divine Revelation which is accepted bythe Muslims only. Or, the Book stands for the Qur’ån, and their disagreement meanstheir rejection of it. The words may, however, be also translated as meaning those whogo against the Book.\n\n177a. While discussing the subject of minor details of the law, a warning is given tothe Muslims that they should not fall into the error into which the previous people fell,who sacrificed the spirit of religion for the outward ceremonial. The essence of religion,we are here told, is faith in God and benevolence towards men. The turning of the faceto the East and the West refers to the outward act of facing a certain direction when saying prayers. This, though necessary, should not be taken as the real object of prayer,which is in fact meant to enable one to hold communion with the Divine Being and to imbue oneself with Divine morals as explained further on. But the words may also carryanother significance. The Muslims were told again and again that all opposition to theTruth would ultimately fail and they would be masters of the land. But temporalgreatness was not their real object. They may conquer Eastern and Western lands buttheir real aim was to attain righteousness and bring others to righteousness.\n\n177b. A belief in angels, while hinted at in the opening verses of this chapter, isclearly spoken of here as one of the basic principles of Islåm. The belief in angels maynot be as universal as a belief in the Divine Being, but it is accepted generally in allmonotheistic religions. As in the case of all other principles of faith, Islåm has pointedout a certain significance underlying the belief in angels. Just as our physical facultiesare not by themselves sufficient to enable us to attain any object in the physical worldwithout the assistance of other agents — as, for instance, the eye cannot see unless thereis light — so our spiritual powers cannot by themselves lead us to good or evil deeds,but here, too, intermediaries which have an existence independent of our internalspiritual powers are necessary to enable us to do good or evil deeds. Now, there are twoattractions placed in man — the attraction to good or to rise up to higher spheres ofvirtue, and the attraction to evil or to stoop down to a kind of low, bestial life; but tobring these attractions into operation, external agencies are needed, as they are needed inthe case of the physical powers of man. The external agency which brings the attractionto good into work is called an angel, and that which assists in the working of theattraction to evil is called the devil. If we respond to the attraction for good we are following the angel or the Holy Spirit, and if we respond to the attraction for evil we arefollowing Satan. Our belief in angels carries, therefore, the significance that wheneverwe feel a tendency to do good we should at once obey that call and follow the inviter togood. That it does not simply mean that we should admit that there are angels is clearfrom the fact that not only are we not required to believe in devils, whose existence is ascertain as that of the angels, but we are plainly told that we should disbelieve in thedevils (v. 256). As a disbelief in the devil means that we should repel the attraction forevil, so a belief in angels means that we should follow the inviter to good.\n\n177c. While a belief in all the prophets is stated to be necessary, the Book is spokenof in the singular. The Book therefore stands for Divine Revelation in general or thescriptures of all the prophets. Or, because the Qur’ån is a Book “wherein are (all) rightbooks” (98: 3), the Book might mean the Qur’ån.\n\n177d. The love of Allåh is here, as in many other places in the Holy Qur’ån, statedto be the true incentive to all deeds of righteousness. \n\n177e. Riqåb is the plural of raqabah, which literally signifies a neck, and thencomes to signify by a synecdoche, a slave, or a captive (T, LL). Hence fi-l-riqåb meansransoming of slaves. The basis was thus laid down for the abolition of slavery. \n\n177f. The performance of promise on the part of individuals as well as of nations isone of the first essentials of the welfare of humanity, and hence the stress laid upon it bythe Holy Qur’ån. Faithlessness to treaties and pledges on the part of nations has wroughtthe greatest havoc on humanity. Just as no society can prosper until its individual members are true to their mutual agreements and promises to each other, so humanity at largecan never have peace unless the nations are true to their agreements.\n\n177g. In the concluding words of the verse, the patient ... in the time of conflict,there is a clear reference to the coming conflicts with the opponents of Islåm, ultimatelyleading to the triumph of Islåm over those who were bent upon extirpating it. \n\n178a. The Jewish law of retaliation is greatly modified in Islåm, being limited onlyto cases of murder, while among the Jews it extended to all cases of grievous hurt. Thewords retaliation is prescribed for you in the matter of the slain, mean that the murderershould be put to death. After promulgating that law in general terms, the Qur’ånproceeds to describe a particular case, viz. that if a free man is the murderer, he himselfis to be slain; if a slave is the murderer, that slave is to be executed; if a womanmurdered a man, it was she that was to be put to death. The pre-Islåmic Arabs used incertain cases to insist, when the person killed was of noble descent, upon the executionof others besides the murderer; they were not content with the execution of the slave orthe woman, if one of them happened to be the murderer. The Holy Qur’ån abolished thiscustom (AH, Rz). \n\n178b. There may be circumstances which alleviate the guilt. In such cases the murderer may be made to pay a fine to the relatives of the murdered person. Such money is calleddiyat or blood-money. The reference to the alleviation of the guilt is plainly contained inthe concluding words of the verse: This is an alleviation from your Lord. A comparisonwith 4: 92 makes it clear that when homicide is not intentional, blood-money may be paid.\n\n179a. Life cannot be safe, we are here told, unless those who are guilty of homicideare sentenced to capital punishment.\n\n 180a. Some commentators hold the opinion that the direction to make a bequest, ascontained in this verse, is abrogated by 4: 11, which fixes the shares of the heirs of thedeceased person. A perusal of that verse shows clearly that it recognizes the validity ofany bequest that may have been made. As a further evidence that the law of making abequest was not abrogated by 4: 11, see 5: 106 (the revelation of which is decidedly laterthan 4: 11), where the calling of witnesses at the time of making a bequest is enjoined. Inpractice, however, traced to the Prophet himself, the right to make a will as regardsone’s property has been subject to the condition that not more than a third of theproperty shall be bequeathed, and that those who take as heirs shall not be entitled totake under the bequest. This is made clear in a √adßth related by Sa‘d ibn Abß Waqqås:“The Messenger of Allåh used to visit me at Makkah, in the year of the FarewellPilgrimage, on account of my illness which had become very severe. So I said: ‘Myillness has become very severe and I have much wealth, and there is none to inherit fromme but a daughter; shall I then bequeath two-thirds of my property as a charity?’ Hesaid, ‘No’. I said, ‘Half?’ He said, ‘No’. Then he said: ‘bequeath one-third, andone-third is much, for if thou leave thy heirs free from want, it is better than that thouleave them in want, begging from people; and thou dost not spend anything seekingthereby the pleasure of Allåh but thou art rewarded for it, even for that which thouputtest into the mouth of thy wife’ ” (B. 23: 36). The mention of the year of the FarewellPilgrimage shows clearly that the incident relates to the last year of the Prophet’s life, toa time when both the verse under discussion and 4: 11 had long been revealed. Hence,the making of a bequest was not contrary to 4: 11, and this verse really speaks ofbequests made for charitable purposes and not of bequests to heirs. It should be furthernoted that the making of bequest is necessary only if a person leaves behind him khairwhich means abundant, or considerable, wealth.There are two other incidents of a still later date which make it clear that thecompanions of the Prophet did not consider this verse to be abrogated. A man whointended to make a bequest came to ‘Å’ishah. She asked him how much property he had,and being told that he had 3000 Dirhams and four heirs, told him not to make a bequestand to leave the amount to his heirs, and recited the words in taraka khairå occuring inthis verse, as showing that the leaving of a large property was a condition for a bequest(Bd). A similar incident is reported in connection with ‘Alß, the fourth Caliph. He had afreedman possessing 700 Dirhams and he expressed a desire to make a bequest. ‘Alß toldhim not to do so, reciting the same words in taraka khairå in support of his contention(Bd). Both these incidents happening after the death of the Prophet, show conclusively:(1) that v. 180 was not regarded as abrogated, because people still made bequests underit; and (2) that the bequests spoken of in this verse were never meant for those who wouldinherit under 4: 11, but for charitable purposes, or for those relatives who could not inheritunder 4:11. \n\n182a. Proper advice may be tendered to the testator, not to show undue favour toanyone or not to exceed the limits of the law to the detriment of the legal heirs. This waswhat the Prophet himself, and ‘Å’ishah and ‘Alß did in the three cases cited in the abovenote. \n\n183a. Fasting is a religious institution almost as universal as prayer, and in Islåm itis one of the five fundamental practical ordinances, the other four being prayer,poor-rate, pilgrimage and jihåd. “Fasting has in all ages and among all nations been anexercise much in use in times of mourning, sorrow and affliction” (Cr. Bib. Con.). It isalso in vogue among the Hindus. Even Christians were recommended by Jesus to keepthe fasts: “Moreover when ye fast, be not as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance. ... Butthou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head and wash thy face” (Matt. 6: 16,      17). Again,when the Pharisees objected to Jesus’ disciples not keeping the fasts as often as John’s,his answer was that when he was taken away, “then shall they fast in those days” (Luke5: 33–35).But Islåm has introduced quite a new meaning into the institution of fasting. BeforeIslåm, fasting meant the suffering of some privation in times of mourning and sorrow; inIslåm, it becomes an institution for the improvement of the moral and spiritual conditionof man. This is plainly stated in the concluding words, so that you may guard againstevil. The object is that man may learn how he can shun evil, and hence fasting in Islåmdoes not mean simply abstaining from food, but from every kind of evil (B. 30: 2).In fact, abstention from food is only a step to make a man realize that if he can, inobedience to Divine injunctions, abstain from that which is otherwise lawful, how muchmore necessary is it that he should abstain from the evil ways which are forbidden byGod. All the institutions of Islåm are, in fact, practical steps leading to perfect purification of the soul. But along with moral elevation, which is aimed at in fasting, anotherobject seems to be hinted at, i.e., that the Muslims should habituate themselves to suffertribulations and hardships physically as well.\n\n184a. The indefiniteness in a certain number of days is removed in the next versewhich states it to be definitely the month of Rama˙ån. \n\n184b. The first two classes exempted are (a) those who are sick and (b) thosejourneying. Both are required to fast afterwards when sickness or journey ends. What issickness or journey every man can determine for himself. A man who needs a medicineor is unable to bear the hardship of hunger or thirst should not fast. In journeying again,whether a man can easily fast or not is the determining factor. The companions of theProphet, we are told, did not find fault with each other in these matters: “We used to beon a journey with the Prophet and he who kept the fast did not find fault with him whobroke it, nor did he who broke the fast find fault with him who kept it” (B. 30: 43). Thethird exception is in the case of those who find it extremely difficult to bear the hardshipof fasting. The word used in the original is yuΔßq∂na from Δåqat which means the utmostthat a man can do (R). The persons meant are those who find it extremely hard(ya©∂m∂na-h∂ jahda-hum wa Δåqata-hum). Such people may effect a redemption bygiving food daily to a poor man. This exception covers the case of the woman who givessuck and the one with child, as also the old man who cannot bear fasting (B. 65: ii,      25);also such sick people whose sickness is prolonged and such people whose journeyextends over the whole year. \n\n184c. Fasting is here called taΔawwu‘, or the spontaneous doing of good, but it alsomeans the doing of an act with effort, and fasting requires great effort on the part ofman. The concluding words of this verse again point out the object of fasting. It nodoubt entails hardship but it serves a very good purpose and brings about great good inthe end. \n\n185a. The revelation of the Holy Qur’ån commenced in the month of Rama˙ån,which is the ninth month of the Arabian year (Rz); hence, the month of Rama˙ån isparticularly spoken of as being the month in which the Holy Qur’ån was revealed. Theroot meaning of Rama˙ån is excessiveness of heat; the month was so called because“when they changed the names of the months from the ancient language, they namedthem according to the seasons in which they fell, and this month agreed with the days ofexcessive heat” (LL, Bd).\n\n185b. Al-Qur’ån is the name by which the Holy Book revealed to the ProphetMu√ammad (peace and the blessings of Allåh be upon him!) is known, and by this namethe Holy Book is frequently mentioned in the Divine revelation. The word is an infinitivenoun from the root qara’a, which signifies primarily he collected together the things(LL). The secondary significance of the root word is reading or reciting a book, the wordbeing applied to reading or recitation because, in reading, letters and words are joined to each other in a certain order (R). The name Qur’ån really refers to both the rootmeanings, for on the one hand it signifies a book in which are gathered together all theDivine Books, a distinction to which the Qur’ån itself lays claim in 98: 3 and elsewhere(R), on the other, it means a book that is or should be read, the Holy Qur’ån being thebook “that has been truly described as the most widely read book in existence” (En. Br.).There are thirty-one different names under which the Holy Qur’ån is spoken of in therevelation itself, the most important of these being al-Kitåb, or the Book, and al-Dhikr, orthe Reminder. The statement is made here that the Qur’ån was revealed in the month ofRama˙ån. Elsewhere we are told that it was revealed on the lailat al-Qadr or the Grandnight or the night of Majesty (97: 1), which is a well-known night in the month ofRama˙ån, being the 25th or 27th or 29th night of that month. By the revelation of theQur’ån in the month of Rama˙ån is therefore meant the commencement of its revelation.The month of Rama˙ån is thus a memorial of the revelation of the Qur’ån. \n\n 185c. There are three statements made here regarding the Holy Qur’ån. Firstly, thatit is a guidance for all men, and that therefore it contains teachings which are suitableand sufficient for all men in all countries and ages. Secondly, that it containscomprehensive arguments for the guidance, thus demonstrating the truth of what itasserts. Thirdly, that it contains arguments which afford a criterion, separating truthfrom falsehood, by making the faithful taste the fruits of faith and rejecters the evilconsequences of their rejection of truth.\n\n185d. There are places on this globe where the days and the nights are so long thatthere exists no division into twelve months. Such cases are exceptional and rare. Peoplethere have no doubt some arrangements to work and rest and to carry on their ownbusiness, and they can also make arrangements for prayers and fasting. See further 187c. \n\n186a. In the midst of ordinances relating to fasting occurs this verse which speaks ofthe nearness of God to man and of the acceptance of his prayers. This is to show that fasting is a spiritual exercise and it brings about spiritual awakening in man. A man isrequired to abstain from satisfying the natural desires of hunger and thirst and to suffercertain privations, not because there is any harm or any moral delinquency in doing so, butsimply because he believes that it is the commandment of God that he should abstain. Asthe Prophet said: “He gives up his food and his drink and his sexual desire for My sake:Fasting is for Me” (B. 30: 2). This undoubtedly awakens a living consciousness of theexistence of God in the mind. This is the idea underlying the words: My servants ask theeconcerning Me. A real and earnest search for God is raised in the mind through fasting.I am near is the reply to that inner search. And then follow the words: I answer theprayer of the suppliant when he calls on Me. God is near, but that consciousness onlyraises the further desire to get nearer and nearer to Him. For that man calls on God; heprays to Him to draw him closer and closer to Himself. And he is told that God acceptsthis prayer. The sincere yearning of the soul of a man to get nearer and nearer to God isalways accepted. But this yearning and this prayer, the verse goes on to say, must beimplemented by acts of obedience: So they should hear My call. Prayer to draw closer toGod is therefore accepted when the earnestness of the soul’s yearning is shown by actsof sacrifice in the way of God.It should be borne in mind that the acceptance spoken of here is primarily in relationto prayers for the attainment of the nearness of God. As regards the acceptance ofprayers generally, prayers for deliverance from distress and affliction and prayers for theattainment of certain temporal benefits, we are told elsewhere: “Him you call upon, soHe removes that for which you pray, if He pleases” (6: 41). He accepts such prayers ordoes not accept them as He pleases. And while God accepts sometimes the prayers evenof the unbelievers and the transgressors (10: 22,      23; 17: 67), and much more frequently ofHis faithful and righteous servants, He tries even the latter by making them sufferhardships; “And We shall certainly try you with something of fear and hunger and lossof property and lives and fruits” (v. 155). Thus while God’s dealing with even thetransgressors is merciful, so that He sometimes accepts their prayers, His dealing withthe faithful who call on Him and pray to Him is that of a friend — listening to theirprayers or requiring them to submit to His will as He pleases.\n\n187a. The mutual relations of husband and wife are here described in words whichcould not be surpassed in beauty. In the first place, the sex instinct, a desire for theopposite sex, is classed with hunger and thirst. It is a natural desire and man could notlive without satisfying it as he could not live without satisfying hunger and thirst. Andthen in these words — your wives are an apparel for you and you are an apparel forthem — we are told that while satisfying a natural desire, the relation of husband andwife has higher ends in view. They serve as a garment for each other, i.e., they are ameans of protection, comfort and even embellishment for each other, and the weaknessof one is made up by the strength of the other.\n\n187b. Takhtån∂n, or you acted unjustly to yourselves, is in reference to the injurywhich they caused to themselves by unnecessarily resisting the sexual craving or hunger and thirst. A case is recorded in which a man overpowered by hunger swooned atmidday (B. 30: 15). ‘Afå which means generally he pardoned or obliterated a wrong,also means he removed or did away with his mistake or misunderstanding or burden(LL). The reports narrated in connection with the revelation of this verse show that theMuslims at first thought that it was illegal to have intercourse with their wives, even atnight, on the days during which they kept fasts. Others abstained from eating, etc., aftergoing to sleep till next evening (B. 30: 15). But this practice was, according to theunanimous opinion of all commentators, not based on any Quranic revelation or anyorder of the Prophet. Speaking of the revelation of this verse Barå’ said: “When fastingin Rama˙ån was enjoined, the Muslims did not approach their wives during the wholemonth of Rama˙ån and some people thus caused injury to themselves; so Allåh revealedthese words” (B. 65:ii,      28). The revelation of these words made it clear that intercoursewith their wives was permitted to the Muslims during the nights of fasting as thesatisfaction of hunger and thirst was permitted. The burden whose removal is referred toin the words ‘afå ‘an-kum was therefore a self-imposed one. \n\n187c. KhaiΔ, which ordinarily means thread, stands here for the tint of the dawn asthe words min al-fajr make it clear; al-khaiΔ al-abya˙ means the whiteness of the dayand al-khaiΔ al-aswad the blackness of the night (LL). This happens generally about anhour and a half before sunrise. The fast is to be broken with the coming of the nightwhich starts with sunset.An important question arises here regarding countries in which the days aresometimes very long, where it would be beyond the power of ordinary men to abstainfrom food from the breaking of the dawn to sunset. There is a report according to whichthe companions of the Prophet are related to have asked him about their prayers in a daywhich extended to a year or a month, and the Prophet is related to have answered thatthey should measure according to the measure of their days (AD 36: 13). From this itwould follow that in countries where the days are too long the time of fasting may bemeasured in accordance with the length of an ordinary day, or where practicablepostpone the fasts to shorter days of about normal length. \n\n187d. Those people are meant who cut themselves off from all worldly connectionsduring the last ten days of the month of Rama˙ån, passing day and night in the mosques.This practice is known as I‘tikåf. It is voluntary and not obligatory.\n\n188a. The injunction to abstain from illegally taking other men’s property is a fittingsequel to the injunction relating to fasting, for by fasting a man abstains from using whathe has a legal right to, simply in obedience to Divine commandments. Fasting, in fact,enables a man to control his passions, and the more the passions are mastered, the lessthe greed for illegal acquisition. \n\n189a. The month of Rama˙ån begins with a new moon and ends with the new moonof Shawwål. The latter is followed by three months, Dhu-l-Qa‘dah, Dhu-l-Ïijjah (withwhich the year closes) and Mu√arram (the first month of the new year). These threealong with Rajab, the seventh month of the year, form the four sacred months, which arereferred to here in the word ahillah, pl. of hilål, meaning the new moon.The indefiniteness of the question is removed by the answer. These were the monthswhich were observed by the Arabs as sacred, in which the bitterest hostilities ceased andpeace was established throughout the land, and thus trade was carried on peacefully andwithout molestation. It was also during these months that the pilgrimage to the sacredsanctuary at Makkah was performed. As this section deals with the injunctions relatingto fighting, the question relating to the sacred months, which is made clearer in v. 217, isappropriately put here, and the answer recognizes the sacred character of those months.Their sacredness afforded to the people the material advantage of being able to carry ontrade and the spiritual benefit of performing the pilgrimage.\n\n189b. The Arabs were a very superstitious people. When one of them set beforehimself an important object and was unable to attain it, he would not go into his houseby the door, but entered it by the back and kept on doing so for a year (Rz). Or, thereference may be to the practice of entering the houses by the back on entering into astate of i√råm for pilgrimage (B. 65: ii,      29). With Islåm all superstitions were sweptaway. Or, entering by the back indicates turning aside from the right course, whileentering by the doors signifies sticking to the right course (Rz). \n\n190a. This is one of the earliest revelations permitting the Muslims to fight. The subject is dealt with here in six verses, closing with v. 195, being again taken up in thefollowing sections. It is remarkable that fighting in the way of Allåh is here expresslylimited to fighting in defence. Muslims were required to fight in the way of Allåh, butthey could fight only against those who waged war on them. Exactly the same limitationis placed on what was in all probability the first revelation permitting fighting:“Permission (to fight) is given to those on whom war is made because they areoppressed” (22: 39).It is clear from both these references that the Muslims were allowed to take up thesword only as a measure of self-defence. The enemies of Islåm, being unable to suppressIslåm by persecution, and seeing that Islåm was now safe at Madßnah and gaining strength,took up the sword to annihilate it. They knew that as yet the Muslims were very few innumber and they thought they could extirpate Islåm, by resorting to the sword. Their waragainst Islåm was a war for the annihilation of Islåm, as stated further on: “They will notcease fighting you until they turn you back from your religion, if they can” (v. 217). Nocourse was left for the Muslims but either to be swept off the face of the earth or take upthe sword in defence against an enemy which was a thousand times stronger.It should be noted that it is this defensive fighting which is called fighting in the wayof Allåh. Fighting for the propagation of faith is not once mentioned in the whole of theQur’ån. \n\n191a. The personal pronoun in the words kill them refers to those with whomfighting is enjoined in the previous verse. When there is a state of war, the enemy maybe killed wherever he is found. \n\n191b. The persecutors had driven the Muslims out from their houses in Makkah andfrom the Sacred Mosque there, which was now the Muslim Spiritual Centre. Thus theMuslims were ordered to carry on war against their persecutors until they weredispossessed of that which they had taken possession of by force. These words furthershow that the enemy was not to be exterminated, but only to be dispossessed of what hehad unlawfully taken.\n\n191c. The word which I have rendered as persecution is fitnah, which originallymeans a burning with fire, and then affliction, distress and hardship, slaughter,misleading or causing to err, and seduction from faith by any means (LL). Anexplanation of these words is met with in v. 217: “They ask thee about fighting in thesacred month. Say: Fighting in it is a grave offence. And hindering (men) from Allåh’sway and denying Him and the Sacred Mosque and turning its people out of it are stillgraver with Allåh, and persecution is graver than slaughter.” Fitnah is thus synonymouswith hindering men from Allåh’s way and the Sacred Mosque, and denying Allåh andturning people out of the Sacred Mosque, and indicates the persecution of the Muslims.Ibn ‘Umar explained the word fitnah when he said: “And there were very few Muslims,so a man used to be persecuted on account of his religion: they either murdered him orsubjected him to tortures until Islåm became predominant, then there was no fitnah”,i.e., persecution (B. 65: ii,      30).\n\n191d. The sacredness of the Inviolable place was not to be violated by the Muslims,notwithstanding the terrible afflictions that they had to suffer there, so long as thedisbelievers were not the aggressors in this respect too and fought with the Muslimswithin the sacred territory. \n\n192a. Note the clemency of the Islåmic fighting injunctions. The Muslims wereto sheathe their swords if the enemy desisted from fighting. The disbelievers tookadvantage of such directions in practising deception on the Muslims: “Those with whomthou makest an agreement, then they break their agreement every time” (8: 56).\n\n193a. When persecution ceases, and men are not forced to accept or renounce areligion, being at liberty to profess any religion of the truth of which they are convinced,then there should be no more fighting. The words that follow make the sense quite clear.If they desist from persecution, the Muslims are at once to stop fighting against them,and hostilities are not to be continued against any except the aggressors.A comparison with 22: 40 will show that this is the correct explanation. There theobject of the Muslim fights is plainly set forth in the following words: “And if Allåh didnot repel some people by others, cloisters and churches and synagogues and mosques inwhich Allåh’s name is much remembered would have been pulled down”. This showsclearly that the Muslims fought not only in defence of mosques, but also in that ofchurches and synagogues, and even of the cloisters of monks. The same object is statedhere in the words religion is only for Allåh, so that there is no persecution on the scoreof religion, and everyone is at liberty to hold any belief which he likes. The verse, infact, lays down the broad principles of religious freedom.If we interpret these words as meaning that fighting is to be continued until allpeople accept Islåm, all those verses in which agreements with the enemy and desistingfrom fighting are spoken of become meaningless. Such an interpretation is belied notonly by the Holy Qur’ån, but by history itself, for many a time did the Prophet makepeace with the unbelievers. \n\n193b. The word ‘udwån here, as also the word i‘tidå used thrice in the followingverse, indicates an exceeding of the proper limit, and hence it is applied to wrongful orunjust conduct, but the punishment by which an injury is inflicted on the offenderfor wrongful conduct is called i‘tidå, for “it is sometimes in the way of aggression andsometimes in the way of requital” (LL). According to R, i‘tad∂ here means requite orpunish him according to his wrongful conduct. The punishment of an evil is frequentlyspoken of in the terms of that evil in the Holy Qur’ån and in Arabic literature; see 15a.The words except against the oppressors signify that hostilities can only be carried onagainst the oppressors, so that when they desist from oppressing, hostilities against themmust be stopped. \n\n194a. This is similar to what is said in v. 191 regarding the Sacred Mosque. If theopponents violated the sacred months by attacking the Muslims first in those months, theMuslims were permitted to fight against them in the sacred months. And generallyretaliation or requital within the limits of the original act of aggression is permitted inthe case of all sacred objects, for inaction in that case would be suicidal. \n\n195a. The defensive wars of the Muslims needed funds and so the Muslims are toldthat they should contribute to the war fund; it is here called spending in the way of Allåh.If they withheld monetary aid to defend themselves when attacked, they would becasting themselves to perdition with their own hands. \n\n196a. Apparently a new subject, the subject of pilgrimage is introduced here, but itwould be seen that the Holy Qur’ån has generally linked up the two subjects of war andpilgrimage. The reason is that the Muslims were free at Madßnah to perform all thereligious ordinances required by Islåm, but they were not free to perform the pilgrimage,their Spiritual Centre, Makkah, being in the possession of their enemies who were at warwith them.Ïajj and ‘umrah, the latter of which is generally translated as the minor pilgrimage,but which may more correctly be rendered as the visit, differ slightly. The ‘umrah maybe performed at any time, whilst the √ajj or the pilgrimage proper can only beperformed at a particular time. Of the ceremonies connected with pilgrimage proper, thestaying on the plain of ‘Arafåt is dispensed with in the case of the ‘umrah. Thus theprincipal requirements of ‘umrah are i√råm, making circuits round the Ka‘bah andrunning between the ˝afå and the Marwah.The pilgrimage in fact represents the last stage in the progress of the spiritual pilgrim.Of the principal requirements of the pilgrimage, the first, or i√råm, represents theseverance of all worldly connections for the love of God. All costly dresses in which theinner self is so often mistaken for the outward appearance, are cast off, and the pilgrimhas only two seamless wrappers to cover himself. The other important requirement ismaking circuits round the Ka‘bah, called Δawåf, and running between the ˝afå and theMarwah, called sa‘y, and both these are external manifestations of that fire of Divine lovewhich has been kindled within the heart, so that like the true lover, the pilgrim makes circuits round the house of his beloved One. He shows in fact that he has completelysurrendered himself to his beloved Master, and sacrificed all his interests for His sake. \n\n196b. Makkah was still in the hands of the opponents of Islåm, who prevented theMuslims from performing the pilgrimage. According to I‘Ab and many other authorities, prevention here means prevention by the enemy and not by a disease, while according to others prevention of both sorts is included (Rz). \n\n196c. The shaving of the head is a sign of the pilgrim getting out of the state ofi√råm. In case of prevention, the offering should be sent to the Sacred House, or if this isnot possible, it should be sacrificed where the pilgrims are detained. \n\n196d. This is a prophecy that a time would come when the power of the enemywould be completely broken down, and the Muslims would make their pilgrimage toMakkah, safe and secure, not having to fear detention. \n\n196e. A combination of the visit and the pilgrimage means that after the performance of the visit, the pilgrim does not remain in the state of i√råm, but again entersinto that state at the time of the pilgrimage. \n\n196f. That is, when you return home after the performance of the pilgrimage. \n\n196g. By this are understood those who do not live in Makkah. \n\n197a. The well-known months are Shawwål, Dhu-l-Qa‘dah and the first nine days of Dhu-l-Ïijjah. It is in these days that a man can enter into the state of i√råm forperforming the pilgrimage. \n\n197b. Three things are prohibited in pilgrimage, rafath, fus∂q and jidål. Rafathmeans foul, unseemly, immodest or obscene speech (LL). Fus∂q, according to a sayingof the Prophet, signifies abusing (Rz). Jidål signifies contending in an altercation ordisputing or litigating (LL). The pilgrimage represents the final stage of spiritualprogress, and hence the pilgrim is enjoined not to speak words which should be a sourceof annoyance to anybody. Perfect love of God requires perfect peace with man; hence nooffence should be caused to any man. The doing of good to others is recommendedinstead in the words whatever good you do, Allåh knows it.\n\n197c. By provision (zåd) is meant provision for the journey to Makkah. Somepeople used to start for a pilgrimage without sufficient means, on the pretence that theytrusted in God for their sustenance. But the words carry a deeper significance, to which areference is contained in the words the best provision being to keep one’s duty, or theguarding of oneself against evil (taqwå), showing that provision for the soul which isthe keeping of one’s duty is more important than provision for the body. \n\n198a. Seeking the bounty of the Lord (al-fa˙l) here stands for trading (Rz). Theword is used in this sense in the Holy Qur’ån in several places, as in 73:20. What ismeant is that there is no harm in seeking an increase of wealth by trading in Makkah inthe pilgrimage season. Before the advent of Islåm, fairs were held for trading purposesin the pilgrimage season, the most well-known of which were the ‘Ukå˚, Majinnah andDhu-l-Majåz. The Muslims thought that to do any work for worldly gain wasinconsistent with the lofty spiritual object which they had in view in the pilgrimage(B. 25: 150). They were told that it was not so and that worldly advancement could becombined with spiritual progress. Conferences could also be called at Makkah duringthe pilgrimage, to inspire the Muslim world with a unity of purpose in their politicaloutlook as also for the solution of other world problems. \n\n198b. ‘Arafåt is the place where the pilgrims assemble on the 9th Dhu-l-Ïijjah. It isat a distance of about nine miles from Makkah. Here the vast gathering from all countriesand nations clad in one dress, with one utterance, labbaika Allåh-umma labbaika (hereI am, O Allåh, in Thy Presence), declares the glory of God. Here the Imåm standing onJabal Ra√mat, the Mountain of Mercy, addresses the whole meeting. The word ‘Arafåt isderived from ‘arafa, he knew, or acquainted himself with, a thing, and there is undoubtedly a reference in this name to the fact that here men feel truly the august Divine presence.Ifå˙ah signifies the advancing or pressing on in journeying with multitude (LL).\n\n198c. The Mash‘ar al-√aråm, which literally signifies the Holy Monument, standsfor the place known as Mu˚dalafah, or the ground bordering on it, where the pilgrimsstop for the night after their return from ‘Arafåt on the evening of the ninth Dhu-lÏijjah. \n\n199a. The Quraish and the Kanånah, who styled themselves the Ïams, as indicatingtheir strength and vehemence, used to stay at Mu˚dalafah, thinking it beneath their dignity to join other pilgrims in going forth to the plain of ‘Arafåt. As all distinctions werelevelled by Islåm, they were told to consider themselves on a par with others (B. 25: 91). \n\n200a. In the days of ignorance they used to boast among themselves of the greatnessof their fathers after they had performed the pilgrimage, when they assembled in ‘Ukå˚and other places. This shows what the Qur’ån destroyed and what it constructed; what itswept away, and what it established in its place. They were forbidden to boast of thegreatness of their fathers, and bidden to celebrate the praise of Allåh instead, as Hewould make them much greater than their forefathers. And the insignificant Arab nationbecame a great nation, the greatest nation of the world, as it combined its physicalconquests with intellectual and moral conquests.\n\n201a. This is the true Muslim’s prayer. As he is taught to pray for both the good ofthis life and that of the next, so he should exert himself to attain good in this life as wellas in the Hereafter. Islåm offers a middle course between materialism and monkery. \n\n203a. The appointed days are the three days following the day of Sacrifice, and arecalled the days of Tashrßq. \n\n203b. Ordinarily pilgrims leave on the afternoon of the last day of Tashrßq days, butthey are allowed to leave on the evening of the second day. \n\n204a. Various conjectures have been made as to the particular person meant, but thebest authorities agree that no particular person is meant (Rz). The context also shows thatthe words relate to mischief-makers, who assured the Prophet of their sympathy withhim, but who were really waiting for an opportunity to inflict loss upon the Muslims. \n\n206a. Mihåd (resting-place) means a cradle, and also what a man has prepared forhimself (LL). Both these significances illustrate the nature of hell. It is a thing which aman prepares for himself; and for a new spiritual growth in the Hereafter in the case ofthose who retarded that growth here by their engrossment in the world or by pursuing anevil course, it serves the same purpose as the cradle for a child. Elsewhere hell is calledan umm or mother (101: 9).\n\n208a. Here the Muslims are told that Truth cannot be established unless they workfor it whole-heartedly. The word silm means peace as well as submission (R). In fact,complete submission to God is synonymous with complete peace. \n\n210a. The coming of Allåh stands for the execution of His command or the comingof the threatened punishment for those who wanted to annihilate Islåm. The matter hasalready been decided, we are told, because it was repeatedly made clear in the earliestrevelations that all opposition to Islåm would be brought to naught. Elsewhere it is said:“Await they aught, but that the angels should come to them or that thy Lord’s commandshould come to pass”. And it is added: “So the evil of what they did afflicted them andthat which they mocked encompassed them” (16: 33,      34). The same phrase is used toindicate the execution of the Divine punishment in 59: 2, where the Jews, who wereultimately banished on account of their mischiefs, are spoken of: “...while they thoughtthat their fortresses would defend them against Allåh, but Allåh came to them from aplace they expected not”. In the shadows of the clouds there is a reference to the comingdown of rain in the battle of Badr (8: 11) which was one of the causes of the destructionof the enemy. \n\n211a. By the favour of Allåh is here meant the Qur’ån and its change implies itsrejection. Compare the buying of error for guidance in v. 16 and elsewhere. The clearsigns which were given to the Israelites include the prophecies of the advent of theProphet, which were repeatedly made known to them through their prophets, as well asthe clear arguments of the truth of the Prophet’s mission, which were clearly convincingwhen compared with the arguments they possessed of the truth of their own prophets. \n\n212a. The Emigrants, having left everything behind and being thus reduced to thelast straits of poverty, were mocked by the wealthy Jews, whose trade of lending moneyat usurious rates brought to them the riches of other peoples. The concluding words notonly show that moral worth which raised a man above another did not depend on wealth,but also contain a prophetic reference to the time when those who were mocked at onaccount of their poverty would have abundance even of the provisions of this life.\n\n213a. The word kåna does not necessarily refer to the past, but is often used in theHoly Qur’ån to convey the idea of a general truth, or to express what is like an attributeof a thing (R). Kån al-insånu kaf∂r-an (17: 67) does not mean man was ungrateful butman is ever ungrateful or that the quality of ungratefulness is met with in him veryfrequently. Similarly, the Divine attributes are often expressed by the use of kåna, as inkån-Allåhu ‘Azßz-an Ïakßm-an (48: 7) which means not that Allåh was Mighty, Wise, butthat Allåh is ever Mighty, Wise; or kån-Allåhu Ghaf∂r-an Raƒßm-an (48: 14) whichmeans Allåh is ever Forgiving, Merciful. Hence the significance adopted. The oneness ofhumanity is a truth on which the Qur’ån lays the greatest stress. They are sometimes toldthat they have all been “created of a single being” (4: 1); again that they are all descended from the same parents (49: 13); still again that they are as it were dwellers in onehome, having the same earth as a resting-place and the same heaven as a canopy(v. 22). It thus lays down the principle of the oneness of humanity in the clearest words.Hence also the conclusion that prophets were raised among all nations which isconveyed in the words that follow. \n\n213b. A universal law of Divine Revelation has been disclosed in these words. Asall people are a single nation, God, too, has been revealing Himself to all. This Law ofDivine Revelation has, we are told, found expression through prophets, to every one ofwhom a revealed Book was given to show them the right way.\n\n213c. The universal law given expression to in this part of the verse is that corruptionfollowed guidance. As time passed on, the very people to whom the Book was given sothat they might follow it, went against it. Thus, though a prophet had been raised in every nation, yet every nation had forsaken the right way, and acted against the very directionswhich had been given to it. Thus differences again arose, which necessitated the adventof another prophet. Hence it was necessary to raise a prophet who should show the rightway to all nations, and this is what is stated in the words that follow. \n\n213d. Allåh’s guiding those who believe refers to the raising of the ProphetMu√ammad, through whom the Muslims were guided to the right path, to the truth,regarding which differences had arisen among all people. If a prophet was needed byevery nation to settle its own differences, one was surely now needed to settle thedifferences of the various nations, for the truth which had been shown to differentnations by different prophets had again become obscured. Thus among the differentnational religions of the world, Islåm occupies the position of an international religion. \n\n214a. The Garden stands for triumph in this life and Paradise in the next. Theconcluding words of the verse, the help of Allåh is nigh, make the reference to thetriumph of the cause of Truth very clear. Truth will only triumph when the upholders ofthe cause of Truth make sacrifices for it and undergo the severest trials for its sake. \n\n214b. This verse inculcates faith and perseverance under the hardest trials and is anindication of the Prophet’s own unequalled endurance and faith. It refers not only to thegreat trials and the hardships which the Muslims had already suffered at Makkah and theprivations which they had to undergo in their exile, but more particularly to thehardships which were yet in store for them, and which they could clearly see in themassing of all forces that could be used to annihilate them. As regards the trials andtribulations of the former prophets, the case of Jesus Christ crying “Eli, Eli, lamasabachthani ” on the cross was the most recent in the history of prophets. \n\n215a. As the fund for the defence of the Muslim society was also utilized for the helpof the parents of some and relatives of others, and the fatherless children and the poor menwho had not the means to quit their homes, who were still being oppressed at Makkah bythe unbelievers, and for the wayfarer who had no security, the Muslims are told that whatthey spent on wars was really for the good of their own helpless relatives and brethren. \n\n216a. Let those ponder who think that the Muslims fought for plunder! They were tooweak to carry on the struggle against the mighty forces that were bent upon their destruction, and they disliked the war. Only a diseased brain could come to the conclusion that theProphet “had now determined to resort to the sword to accomplish what his preaching hadfailed to do”. Where were the military forces with which the Prophet was going to convertthe proud and warring Arabs who had not listened to his word? His first army at Badr,when the Quraish of Makkah were marching upon Madßnah with a thousand of their mostexperienced warriors, was 313, including boys of thirteen years of age. Could any sensibleman say that the Prophet was now going to convert the hundreds of thousands of Arabwarriors with his 313 unequipped and inexperienced followers? And do not the very wordsof the verse give the lie to this most irrational conclusion? A picture of distresses andafflictions to which the few converts to Islåm were subjected is drawn in v. 214. Theywere few in numbers, poor, exiled, and distressed, yet it became inevitable that theyshould fight in self-defence or they would be destroyed. It was their utter weakness and theenormous disparity of numbers that made them dislike the fighting. And I may add that nota single instance is recorded in the whole of the Prophet’s history showing the conversionof an unbeliever under pressure of the sword, not a single case is met with of an expeditionundertaken to convert a people. If ever in the world’s history a people were compelled tofight in the defence of a great cause, no nobler instance of it could be given than that of theProphet with his few faithful followers braving the whole of Arabia, with enemies on allsides who had taken up the sword to annihilate them. If ever there was a just cause for war,there never was one more just than the cause of humanity at large, the combined cause ofthe Christian church, of the Jewish synagogue, of the Sabian’s house of worship, and ofthe Muslim mosque, which the early Muslims set before themselves (22: 40). Read alongwith this verse what is stated in v. 190 and 22: 39, and the conditions under which thisinjunction was given will become clear. It was an injunction to fight against those whotook up the sword first and turned the Muslims out of their homes. It was an injunctionto fight to end persecution and to establish religious freedom, and to save the houses ofworship of every religion from being ruined.\n\n217a. The opening words of this verse prohibit fighting in the sacred months (thereasons for which are given in v. 189), except by way of reprisal (see v. 194). But at thesame time the unbelievers are told that the wrongs they inflicted on the Muslims, nevercaring for the sacred months and the sacred territory, were worse than slaughter. Thenwe are told that the unbelievers took up the sword to force the Muslims back intounbelief and that they were determined to carry on the war until they gained thisend. Note the words they will not cease fighting you until they turn you back from yourreligion, if they can, which give the lie direct to the assertion that the Muslims startedwar to convert the unbelievers by force. \n\n217b. The persons spoken of in this passage are the apostates. A wrong impressionexists among non-Muslims, and among many Muslims as well, that the Holy Qur’ånrequires those who apostatize from Islåm to be put to death. This is not true. OneChristian writer has gone so far as to misconstrue the word fa-yamut as meaning he shallbe put to death, while even a beginner knows that the significance of these words is thenhe dies. What is stated here is that the opponents of Islåm exerted themselves to theirutmost to turn back the Muslims from their faith by their cruel persecutions, and therefore if a Muslim actually went back to unbelief he would be a loser in this life as well asin the next, because the desertion of Islåm would not only deprive him of the spiritualadvantages which he could obtain by remaining a Muslim, but also of the physicaladvantages which must accrue to the Muslims through the ultimate triumph of Islåm.Neither here nor anywhere else in the Holy Qur’ån is there even a hint at the infliction ofcapital or any other punishment on the apostate.The only report which records a case of death being inflicted on apostates is that of theparty of ‘Ukl, who, after professing Islåm, feigned that the climate of Madßnah wasinsalubrious, and, being told to go to the place where the herds of camels belonging to thestate were grazed, murdered the keepers and drove the herds along with them. The facts ofthe case clearly show that capital punishment in this case was not inflicted for change offaith, but on account of the crime of murder and dacoity. This case is generally cited by the commentators under 5: 33, which speaks of the punishment of dacoits. There is no othercase showing that the punishment of death was ever inflicted on apostasy from Islåm.It may, however, be added that after the first eighteen months of their residence atMadßnah, the Muslims were in a state of constant warfare with the Quraish and the Arabtribes, and apostasy, under these circumstances, meant the desertion of the cause of theMuslims and joining their enemies. Even if death had been prescribed for the apostates,it would have been on the ground of their joining the enemy forces, not on the ground ofchange of religion. In the matter of religion, the Qur’ån gives perfect freedom to everyone to adopt whatever religion he likes: “Say: The Truth is from your Lord; so let himwho please believe, and let him who please disbelieve” (18: 29). \n\n219a. “Khamr means wine or grape-wine. ... It has a common application tointoxicating expressed juice of anything (Q, T) or any intoxicating thing that clouds orobscures (lit., covers) the intellect, as some say ... and the general application is themore correct, because khamr was forbidden when there was not in El-Madßnah anykhamr of grapes” (LL). It will thus be seen that the word khamr includes all intoxicatingsubstances, and therefore I make a departure in translating it as intoxicants, and not aswine or intoxicating liquors. The prohibition of intoxicants in connection with themention of war shows that Islåm wanted to inspire true courage into its followers anddisliked the reckless daring which a man shows under the influence of intoxicatingliquors and which has so often led to acts of butchery in wars. The prohibition spoken ofhere as regards both intoxicating liquors and games of chance is made plainer in 5: 90:“O you who believe, intoxicants and games of chance ... are only an uncleanness, thedevil’s work; so shun it that you may succeed”.The change which these simple words brought about in Arabia will always remain ariddle to the social reformer. The constant fighting of Arab tribes, one against the other,had made the habit of drink second nature to the Arab, and wine was one of the very fewobjects which could furnish a topic to the mind of an Arab poet. Intoxicating liquorswere the chief feature of their feasts, and the habit of drink was not looked upon as anevil, nor had there ever been a temperance movement among them, the Jews and theChristians being themselves addicted to this evil. Human experience with regard to thehabit of drink is that of all evils it is the most difficult to be uprooted. Yet but one wordof the Holy Qur’ån was sufficient to blot out all traces of it from among a whole nation,and afterwards from the whole of the country as it came over to Islåm. History cannotpresent another instance of a wonderful transformation of this magnitude brought aboutso easily, yet so thoroughly. It may also be added here that Sale’s remark that “themoderate use of wine is allowed” and that only drinking to excess is prohibited,according to some, is absolutely without foundation. The companions of the Prophetnever made use of a drop of wine after the prohibition was made known, and the Prophetis reported to have said: “A small quantity of anything of which a large quantity isintoxicating is prohibited” (AD. 25: 5). Nor does Kf say what Sale attributes to him, forthe words which give rise to Sale’s misconception deal with, not wine, but anotherpreparation regarding which there is a difference of opinion among the jurists. \n\n219b. The original word is maisir, derived from yasara, meaning he dividedanything into parts or portions. Maisir was a game of hazard with the Arabs, and in thelegal language of Islåm includes all games of chance. Some derive it from yusr, meaningease because of the ease with which wealth could be attained by it. Wine and gambling are both declared in 5: 91 as causing “enmity and hatred among you”, and a society themembers of which are imbued with feelings of hatred and enmity towards each othercould never prosper. \n\n220a. In consequence of the fighting, it was inevitable that many children would beleft orphans, so an injunction regarding the care of orphans is added here. But it may beadded that the earliest revelations of the Holy Qur’ån always speak of the orphans, theneedy, and the slave in the kindest words, and lay special stress on helping and feedingthem. See 90: 11–16 and other places. \n\n220b. The word used here is tukhåliΔ∂-hum which carries a double significance: (1)Mix or associate with them, (2) Join with them in their affairs, i.e., become co-partnerswith them. So orphans are not to be treated as a separate class, and they should not betreated as living on the charity of others, which would develop an inferiority complex inthem; they must be treated as brethren, as plainly stated here. And further, co-partnership with an orphan is expressly allowed here, because when strict injunctions weregiven regarding the safeguarding of orphans’ property, some men thought that it was asin to have anything to do with it (Rz). The concluding words of the verse show that theobject in allowing co-partnership with them is simply to facilitate matters. If a personaims at mischief, he cannot escape God’s punishment.\n\n221a. The questions dealt with in this section arose in connection with the war. Theprevious verse speaks of the orphans whose numbers were no doubt to be greatlyincreased by the wars. This verse deals with intermarriages with idolaters. The war withthe idolaters, who were now not a people differing in religious views only but enemiesbent upon the destruction of the Muslims, had brought new conditions into existence.Intermarriages with those who were warring upon the Muslims could have led to serioustroubles and numerous complications. A reference to 60: 10 will show that even themarital relations already existing with these people had to be ended on account of thewar. Hence the prohibition of such intermarriages. The subject of intermarriages withnon-Muslims generally is fully dealt with in 5: 5b. \n\n221b. The reference in these words is not only to the religious beliefs of the twoparties, the idolater and the believer in the Unity of God, but also to the constantstruggle which would be going on in such a household. The outlook on life of theMuslim and the idolater are poles asunder and the harmony and the mutual love betweenhusband and wife which marriage aims at can never be attained. Moreover such a unionwould mean ruination of the offspring which would have to be brought up in such anatmosphere. \n\n222a. Just as war made many children orphans, it made many women widows, butquestions relating to widowhood and divorce being somewhat analogous, the twoquestions are treated together in this section and the two that follow. In fact warconditions also necessitated divorce in certain cases, for which see 60:10. The subject ofmonthly courses of women comes in as a preliminary to the question of divorce, forwhich see 65:1. As the answer shows, the question relates to relations with womenduring the monthly courses.\n\n222b. Adh-an signifies a slight evil, slighter than what is termed ˙arar (LL), oranything that causes a slight harm (LL). It is not, however, the menstrual discharge thatis called harmful here but having sexual relations while the woman is in that condition.The Jewish law contains a similar prohibition in Lev.18: 19 and 20: 18, though Jewishpractice rendered it necessary that the separation between husband and wife should becomplete. In Islåm, it is limited to the cessation of sexual intercourse.\n\n223a. Annå means either matå, i.e., when, or kaifa, i.e., how (AH). As the previousverse prohibits certain relations when the woman has her courses on, this one states thatkeeping that prohibition in view, a man may go in to his wife when he likes and as helikes. The Qur’ån contains directions for the physical as well as the moral and spiritualwelfare of man, and it deals with the most delicate questions in language unapproachedin its purity in any other law dealing with similar questions. Many of the phrases dealingwith the delicate relations of the sexes were introduced by the Holy Qur’ån itself, and itsliterature is therefore one which brings no shudder to the fair reader, unlike many ofthe descriptions contained in the Bible. The comparison of the woman to the tilth issimply to show that it is she who brings up the children and through whom is made thecharacter of the man, and to show that the real object of conjugal relations is not simplythe satisfaction of carnal desires. \n\n224a. This verse introduces another preliminary to the subject of divorce. Ílå’ was away of temporarily putting off the wife, for which see 226a, and this was effected by anoath in Allåh’s name not to go in to one’s wife, the result of which was that the husbandconsidered himself free from all marital obligations. The first step to bring about a reformin the relations of husband and wife was that this practice was abolished. It is in referenceto this that the taking of oaths against the doing of good to others is prohibited. The fulfilment of marital obligations is thus referred to as the doing of good and observance of dutyand making peace between men. But the subject is generalized and the taking of all oathsto forbid oneself the doing of good or fulfilment of obligations is prohibited. \n\n225a. By vain oaths are meant unintentional or thoughtless oaths in ordinaryconversation, and by what the hearts have earned is meant an oath intentionally taken.\n\n226a. Ílå’ signifies an oath that one shall not go in to one’s wife. In the days of ignorancethe Arabs used to take such oaths frequently, and as the period of suspension was not limited,the wife was compelled sometimes to pass her whole life in bondage, having neither the position of a wife nor that of a divorced woman free to marry elsewhere. The Qur’ån declares thatif the husband does not reassert conjugal relations within four months, the wife shall bedivorced. Cases in which husbands desert wives, having neither conjugal relations with themnor divorcing them, are similar to the case of ßlå’, and must be dealt with practically asamounting to ßlå’, so that after four months the wife should be set free if she wants a divorce. \n\n226b. By going back is meant the re-establishing of conjugal relations.\n\n227a. Ôalåq is an infinitive noun from Δalaqat, said of a woman, meaning she was leftfree to go her way or become separated from her husband, and signifies the dissolving ofthe marriage tie (LL). The subject of divorce, which is introduced here, is dealt with inthis and the following two sections, and further on in the 4th,      33rd and 65th chapters.Divorce is one of the institutions of Islåm regarding which much misconception prevails, so much so that even the Islamic law as administered in the courts, is not free fromthese misconceptions. The chief features of the Islamic law of divorce, as dealt with in theHoly Qur’ån, are discussed in vv. 228–233 and 236; the procedure is laid down in 4: 35,while further questions are dealt with in 33: 49 and 65: 1–7. The Islamic law has manypoints of advantage as compared with both the Jewish and Christian laws as formulated inDeut. and Matt. The chief feature of improvement is that the wife can claim a divorceaccording to the Islamic law, neither Moses nor Christ conferring that right on the woman,though it is to be regretted that this very feature is the one that is not recognized now evenin some Muslim countries. Another feature of the Islamic law of divorce is that it is elasticand does not strictly limit the causes of divorce. In fact, if the civilized nations of Europeand America, who own the same religion, are at the same stage of advancement and havean affinity of feelings on most social and moral questions, cannot agree as to the causes ofdivorce, how could a universal religion like Islåm, which was meant for all ages and allcountries, for people in the lowest grade of civilization as well as those at the top, limitthose causes, which must vary with the varying conditions of humanity and society?It may also be added here that, though divorce is allowed by Islåm if sufficient reasonexists, yet the right is to be exercised under exceptional circumstances. The Qur’ån itselfapproves of the Prophet insisting on Zaid not divorcing his wife notwithstanding a dissension of a sufficiently long standing (33: 37). And the Prophet’s memorable words, of allthings which have been permitted divorce is the most hated by Allåh (AD. 13: 3), willalways act as a strong check on any loose interpretation of the words of the Holy Qur’ån. \n\n228a. The period of waiting, or ‘iddat, forms the first condition in the Islamic law ofdivorce. But for cases in which marriage is not consummated, no period of waiting isnecessary; see 33:49.\n\n228b. These words give a clear right to the parties to effect a reconciliation andre-establish conjugal relations within the period of waiting. No special procedure isnecessary for this but both the divorce and the reconciliation must take place in thepresence of witnesses (IM. 10: 5). If, however, the ‘iddat is over and no reconciliationhas been effected, the relation of husband and wife can be re-established by re-marriage,which right is given to the parties by v. 232.The period of waiting is really a period of temporary separation during which conjugal relations may be re-established as clearly stated in the words that follow. This periodof temporary separation serves as a check upon divorce. If there is any love in the union,its pangs would assert themselves during the period of temporary separation, bringingabout a reconciliation, and the differences would sink into insignificance. This is the bestsafeguard against a misuse of divorce, for in this way only such unions would be endedby divorce as really deserve to be ended, being devoid of the faintest spark of love. Aconjugal union without love is a body without a soul, and the sooner it is ended the better.\n\n228c. The rights of women against their husbands are here stated to be similar tothose which the husbands have against their wives. The statement must, no doubt, havecaused a stir in a society which never recognized any rights for the woman. The changein this respect was really a revolutionizing one, for the Arabs hitherto regarded womenas mere chattels. Women were now given a position equal in all respects to that of men,for they were declared to have rights similar to those which were exercised against them.This declaration brought about a revolution not only in Arabia but in the whole world,for the equality of the rights of women with those of men was never previously recognized by any nation or any reformer. The woman could no longer be discarded at thewill of her “lord”, but she could either claim equality as a wife or demand a divorce. \n\n228d. The statement that “men are a degree above them” does not nullify the rightsasserted in the previous passage. The words are added simply to show that superiorauthority to run the house must be given to either the husband or the wife, and it is givento the husband for reasons stated in 4: 34; see 4: 34a.\n\n229a. The divorce spoken of here is the revocable divorce of v. 228, after which areconciliation may be effected in the waiting period. In the days of ignorance a manused to divorce his wife and take her back within the prescribed time, even though he might do this a thousand times. Islåm reformed this practice by allowing a revocabledivorce on two occasions only, so that the period of waiting in each of these two casesmight serve as a period of temporary separation during which conjugal relations couldbe re-established. As shown in 228b, even re-marriage of the same parties is allowedafter the lapse of the waiting period. \n\n229b. The husband must make his choice after the second divorce either to retainthe wife permanently or to bring about a final separation. The object of a true marriageunion is indicated in the simple words keep them in good fellowship. Where the union ischaracterized by quarrels and dissensions instead of good fellowship, and twoexperiences of a temporary separation show that there is no real love in the union, andgood fellowship is therefore entirely absent; the only remedy that remains is to let thewoman go with kindness. It is both in the interests of the husband and the wife and in theinterests of society itself that such a union should be brought to a termination, so that theparties may seek a fresh union. But even in taking this final step the woman must betreated kindly. \n\n229c. The full payment of the dowry to the woman is another condition relating tothe Islamic law of divorce, and it serves as a very strong check upon the husband inresorting to unnecessary divorce. \n\n229d. These words give the wife a right to claim a divorce. It is one of the distinguishing characteristics of Islåm that it gives the wife the right to claim a divorce, if sheis willing to forgo the whole or part of her dowry. The case of Jamßlah, wife of ThåbitIbn Qais, is one that is reported in numerous reports of the highest authority. Here it wasthe wife who was dissatisfied with the marriage. There was not even a quarrel, as sheplainly stated in her complaint to the Prophet: “I do not find any fault with him onaccount of his morals (i.e., his treatment) or his religion”. She only hated him. And theProphet had her divorced on condition that she returned to her husband the orchardwhich he had made over to her as her dowry (B. 68: 12). It is even said that thehusband’s love for the wife was as intense as her hatred for him (Rz). If, then, a womancould claim a divorce for no reason other than the unsuitableness of the match, she hadcertainly the right to claim one if there was ill-treatment on the part of the husband orany other satisfactory reason, and among the early Muslims it was an established right.Even now it is a right which is maintained in many Muslim countries. Technically sucha divorce is called Khul‘.It will be noted that though this verse forms the basis of the law relating to Khul‘,the words indicate an unwillingness on the part of both spouses to continue the marriagerelation — unless both fear that they cannot keep within the limits of Allåh. This isexplained as meaning their inability to perform towards each other their maritalobligations and to maintain good fellowship (B. 68: 13). The reason for this, apparently,is that the passage follows one requiring a permanence of relationship that can no more be broken when the husband has adopted this choice after a second divorce, so that therelation can only be broken if the wife finds it unbearable. Another reason seems to bethat the woman is usually the last to be willing to break up the marriage relationship.The words if you fear evidently refer to the properly constituted authorities and thisshows that the authorities can interfere in the matter. Cases are actually on record inwhich a wrong done by an unjust divorce was mended by the authorities.\n\n230a. The words refer to the “putting off with kindness” of the previous verse, andhence by divorce here is meant the irrevocable divorce pronounced a third time, i.e.,after there has been a divorce and a restitution of conjugal rights twice.\n\n230b. When the wife has been divorced twice, after each of which reconciliation hasbeen effected and has failed, the third divorce becomes irrevocable, and the husbandcannot remarry the divorced wife until she has been married elsewhere and divorced.The verse abolishes the immoral custom of √alålah, or temporary marriage gonethrough with no other object than that of legalizing the divorced wife for the firsthusband, a custom prevalent in the days of Ignorance, but abolished by the Prophet,according to a report which speaks of his having cursed those who indulge in the evilpractice (Tr. 9: 25). There must be a genuine marriage and a genuine divorce.This restriction makes the third divorce a very rare occurrence, and thus acts asanother check against frequent divorce. Muir’s remarks as to the hardship which thisrule involves not only for “the innocent wife” but also for the “innocent children”, for“however desirous the husband may be of undoing the wrong, the decision cannot berecalled”, are totally unjustified. The irrevocable divorce cannot be pronounced until atemporary separation has taken place twice and both experiences have shown that themarriage relationship cannot be continued. It is not simply by repeating the pronouncement of divorce thrice that the third pronouncement becomes irrevocable. A divorceshould actually have taken place twice, followed each time by reconciliation, then andonly then the third divorce becomes irrevocable. It would, in fact, be very rare. The caseof Rukånah affords an illustration. He divorced his wife in the time of the Prophet thricebut this was counted as a single divorce, and he took back his wife by the Prophet’sorder. Then he divorced her in the time of ‘Umar and reconciliation was again effected,and finally he divorced her in the time of ‘Uthmån (AD. 13: 3). \n\n231a. Hence, if the husband is proved to give injury to the wife, he cannot retainher, and she can claim a divorce. Injury to the wife may be of a general nature or onegiven with the object of compelling her to remit the whole or part of her dowry to obtaina divorce. This practice was resorted to by the pre-Islamic Arabs, and the words aremeant to abolish the evil (Rz). It is for the judge to see that the husband is not takingundue advantage of his position. On the other hand, the husband is enjoined to show liberality to the divorced wife, and the judge would no doubt see that the injunctions of theHoly Book were observed. It is made clear in 4: 35 that decision in matters of divorcerests with the judges appointed, not with the husband or the wife.\n\n231b. The injunctions relating to the kind treatment of women must not be takenlightly, we are told here. Retaining women to cause them injury has already beendeclared to be a transgression and emphasis is now laid on the proper observance ofthese injunctions by stating that these are most serious matters relating to the welfare ofsociety as a whole. \n\n232a. It has already been stated that when a divorce is pronounced, the conjugalrelations can be re-established within the period of waiting. Here it is stated that if theperiod of waiting has elapsed, even then the former husband can remarry the divorcedwife. The sister of Ma‘qil ibn Yasår was divorced by her husband and when the ‘iddahwas over, the husband again approached Ma‘qil to give her in marriage to him. She waswilling but Ma‘qil did not agree. Then this verse was revealed (B. 65:ii,      40). Thus the marriage of a divorced woman with her former husband is clearly allowed, and goingthrough the mock ceremony of marriage with another person is an innovation.\n\n233a. By mothers here are meant in particular, as the context shows, women whohave been divorced having children to suckle.\n\n233b. In case the father dies before the child is weaned, the heir is bound to pay theexpenses. \n\n234a. The period of waiting in the case of a widow is four months and ten days. Butin case a divorced woman or a widow is with child, the period of waiting is extended tothe time of delivery (65: 4).\n\n234b. The meaning is that the widow may look out for a husband and remarry.\n\n235a. The word kitåb, lit. writing, means here the period of waiting written downfor women, so that a marriage contracted during that period is illegal.\n\n236a. The farß˙ah or the portion is the dowry, so that even when no dowry has beenagreed upon, and marriage has not been consummated, liberality must be shown to thedivorced wife, and some provision should be made for her, even though the husbandmay be in straitened circumstances.\n\n237a. The husband is the person in whose hand is the marriage tie. His forgoing hisdue is equivalent to not claiming the half of the dowry which he is entitled to by thisverse. Note that forgoing on the part of husbands is here stated to be the more commendable course. \n\n237b. By fa˙l is meant here the doing of an act of grace or bounty, that which one isnot in duty bound to do; and therefore what is implied is the giving of free gifts. \n\n238a. WasaΔ, of which wusΔå is the comparative form, means both middle andexcellent, for wasaΔ refers sometimes to place and sometimes to degree (R). Al-˝alåtal-wusΔå means the best or the most excellent prayer, not the middle prayer, becausewusΔå is in the comparative degree, and middle does not admit of comparison. InÏadßth the later afternoon prayer, ‘Asr, is spoken of as Al-˝alåt al-wusΔå (B. 56: 98).This name may have been given to it because from the point of the businessman it isthe busiest part of the day and hence he finds it most difficult to find time for it. Butthere are several other suggestions regarding what is meant by it, and maybe it doesnot refer to any particular prayer and means simply attending to prayer in the mostexcellent form. The guarding of prayers is not simply the observance of the outwardform; it is both the form and the spirit to which attention is drawn. Prayers are to besaid at stated times and a particular method is to be observed, for if regularity andmethod had not been adopted, the institution of prayer which is so helpful in keepingalive a true faith in God in the heart of a Muslim would have passed into mereidealism as in other religions. The fact is that to keep the spirit of man in touch withthe Divine Spirit, an external form was necessary, and it is absurd to jump to theconclusion that because Islåm requires an external form to be kept up, the Islamicprayer is devoid of spirit. The external form is needed to bring the inner faculty intoexercise. As regards the spirit of prayer, attention is called to it again and again in theHoly Qur’ån. On this very occasion, the injunction to guard the prayers is followed bythe words: Stand up truly obedient to Allåh. That is the spirit which prayer aims atgenerating, the spirit of obedience to God. Elsewhere we are told: “Prayer keeps (one)away from indecency and evil” (29: 45). In fact, the Qur’ån condemns prayers whichare devoid of spirit (107: 4–6). \n\n239a. The reference to danger is danger from the enemy, who might make anonslaught on the Muslims if they neglected their defence when attending to prayer. There is thus a reversion here to the subject of fighting, which is really dealt with throughoutthis chapter. The laying of stress on prayers in the previous verse is also due to the factthat prayer was in danger of being neglected when fighting. It should also be noted thatthe question of widowhood, which is being dealt with here, is closely associated withfighting, because wars must increase the number of widows. The subject of fighting isplainly reverted to in the next section. \n\n240a. There is nothing to show that this verse is abrogated by any other verse of theHoly Qur’ån. Neither v. 234, nor 4: 12, contains anything contradicting this verse. Theformer of these speaks of the period of waiting for a widow, but here we have nothingabout the period of waiting; it simply speaks of a bequest on the part of the husband thatthe widow should be given an additional benefit, a year’s residence and maintenance.The latter portion of the verse plainly says that if the widow of her own accord leavesthe house, she is not entitled to any further concession, and there is no blame on theheirs of the deceased husband for what the widow does of lawful deeds, i.e., if sheremarries after her waiting period of four months and ten days is over. As regards 4: 12,the fourth or eighth part of the property of the deceased husband is hers in addition towhat she obtains under this verse, and 4: 12 plainly says that anything which is to be paidunder a will shall have precedence of the division of property into shares under thatverse. Mujåhid’s explanation of this verse is exactly the same: “Allåh gave her (i.e., thewidow) the whole of a year, seven months and twenty days being optional under thebequest; if she desired she could stay according to the bequest (i.e., having maintenanceand residence for a year), and if she desired she could leave the house (and remarry),as the Qur’ån says: Then if they themselves go away, there is no blame on you”(B. 65: ii,      41).\n\n241a. Note that this provision is in addition to the dowry which must be paid tothem. Just as in the previous verse the widow is given an additional benefit, here a provision in addition to her dowry is recommended for the divorced woman. This shows howliberal are the injunctions of the Holy Qur’ån regarding women.\n\n243a. Ul∂f is plural either of alf, meaning a thousand, or alif, a congregation or in astate of union (LL). The thousands referred to in this verse are the Israelites who leftEgypt with Moses, the whole body of the Israelites being called a congregation in theTorah, and the clear mention of the Children of Israel after Moses in v. 246 corroboratesthis. Here we have a people who left their homes for fear of death, and besides theIsraelites’ exodus from Egypt no incident in history answers to this description. In fact,the very word kharaj∂ (they went forth) from khur∂j (meaning exodus) contains a directhint to the exodus of the Israelites. But in one respect, the Holy Qur’ån differs from theBible. According to the latter, the number of the Israelites was over 600,      000 when theyleft Egypt (Num. 1: 46), but the Qur’ån says they were thousands, not hundreds ofthousands. There is no doubt, too, that the Israelites left Egypt for fear of death, fordeath would surely have been their fate if they had not emigrated. Not only were ordersgiven by Pharaoh for their male offspring to be killed, but they were also kept in a stateof bondage which would soon have brought them to a state of intellectual and moraldeath (compare v. 49).The next incident in the history of that nation as referred to here is the Divinecommandment to them, to “die”. This is more fully stated in 5: 21–26. Moses told themto enter the Holy Land “which Allåh has ordained for you,” but they refused and weremade to wander about in the wilderness for forty years, so that that generation perished.This is also shown by their history as given in the Old Testament: “Your carcases shallfall in this wilderness ... doubtless ye shall not come into the land” (Num. 14: 29,      30).This was their death. After that, we are told, Allåh gave them life. This refers to the nextgeneration, which was made to inherit the promised land: “But your little ones ... theyshall know the land which ye have despised” (Num. 14: 31). The whole is meant as awarning for the Muslims, who are told that if they followed the footsteps of theIsraelites, death must be their fate. This warning is made clear in the next verse: Andfight in the way of Allåh. \n\n244a. See 2: 190; fighting in Allåh’s way is equivalent to fighting in defence of faith. \n\n245a. Commenting on this verse, LL says: “It means, according to AIs, thegrammarian, who is he who will offer unto God a good action or gift, or any thing forwhich a requital may be sought; or, as Akh, one of the most famous grammarians says,who will do a good action by following and obeying the command of God ”; and he adds:“The Arabs say, qad aqra˙ta-nß qar˙-an √asan-an, which signifies thou hast done tome a good deed which I am bound to requite” (T, LL). According to Zj, qar˙ signifiesanything done on which a reward may be expected (Rz). \n\n 245b. Allåh receives and amplifies means that Allåh receives the gift that is offeredto Him and then amplifies it; in other words, any sacrifice made in the cause of Truth isamply rewarded by Allåh. Or, it is a general statement indicating that the tightening ofthe means of subsistence and their amplification are in the hands of Allåh, for yaqbi˙ualso means he straitens. \n\n246a. The prophet alluded to is Samuel: “Nevertheless the people refused to obeythe voice of Samuel; and they said, Nay; but we will have a king over us ... that our kingmay judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles” (1 Sam. 8: 19,      20). In thehistory which follows, the Qur’ån does not show any important difference with the Biblenarrative. \n\n246b. 1 Sam. 15: 33 shows that the Amalekites had killed the Children of Israel,while 1 Sam. 17: 1 shows that they had taken lands which belonged to Judah. \n\n247a. Saul is here called Ôål∂t, which is of the measure of fa‘l∂t from Δala meaninghe or it was tall, and he is so called on account of the tallness of his stature: “And whenhe stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people” (1 Sam. 10: 23).The proper names used in the Holy Qur’ån, while differing slightly from the Hebreworiginals, have a significance of their own\n\n247b. The murmurings of the people on Saul’s selection as king, as recorded in theHoly Qur’ån, have something corresponding to them in the Bible: “And Saul answeredand said, Am not I a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? And my familythe least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin?” (1 Sam. 9: 21). And again: “Butthe children of Belial said, How shall this man save us? And they despised him, andbrought him no presents” (1 Sam. 10: 27). \n\n247c. Compare 1 Sam. 10: 24: “And Samuel said to all the people, See ye himwhom the Lord hath chosen, that there is none like him among all the people?”. \n\n248a. The tåb∂t mentioned here has given rise to a number of stories, because of itstwofold significance. It means a chest or a box, and it also signifies the bosom or theheart (LL). Taking the first significance, the reference is said to be to the ark, to which,however, it is objected that the ark was restored to the Israelites long before the time ofSaul. But we cannot be so certain of the Bible narrative as to reject as untrue everythingdiffering from it. I prefer, however, the latter significance, and the use of the word inthat sense is well known. LL quotes the proverb, må auda‘tu tåb∂tß shai-an faqadtu-h∂,i.e., I have not deposited in my bosom anything of knowledge that I have lost. R alsosays that tåb∂t denotes qalb or the heart, and he quotes ‘Umar as speaking of IMsd, “avessel filled up with knowledge,” referring evidently to the heart. That the word is usedin the Holy Qur’ån in this sense is clear from the description of it that follows.Tranquillity from the Lord is not a thing which is placed in boxes, but the heart is its realrepository. On five other occasions the coming down of sakßnah, or tranquillity, ismentioned in the Holy Qur’ån, and every time it is the heart of the Prophet or thefaithful that is the recipient of it. For instance in 48: 4 it is said: “He it is Who sent downtranquillity into the hearts of the believers that they might add faith to their faith”.According to LA, sakßnah means also mercy; and he quotes a saying of the Prophet:“There came down upon them mercy (Ar. sakßnah), the angels bearing it.”By the coming of “the heart in which there is tranquillity” is meant the changewhich came over Saul when he was made king: “And it was so, that when he had turnedhis back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart” (1 Sam. 10: 9). This exactlycorresponds with the statement made in the Qur’ån. And further it is said: “And theSpirit of God came upon him and he prophesied” (1 Sam. 10: 10). This is no doubt thebest of what the true followers of Moses and Aaron left. \n\n248b. The word baqiyyah means both a residue and excellence or the best of a thing(LL). You say baqiyyat al-qaum meaning the best of the people (LL). Ul∂ baqiyyat-in in the Holy Qur’ån (11: 116) means persons possessed of excellence. And baqiyyat-Allåh(11: 86) signifies obedience, or the state of goodness that remains. Hence baqiyyah ineither sense signifies the blessings of the earlier days. And thus it became a proverbamong the Israelites: “Is Saul also among the prophets?” (1 Sam. 10: 12). \n\n248c. The ark of 1 Samuel 4: 4 was drawn by bullocks and not by angels, and since,according to the Holy Qur’ån, the bearers of the tåb∂t were angels, it is additional reasonthat by tåb∂t here is meant the heart. But see a saying of the Prophet quoted in 248a,from which it is clear that “it” in the verse may refer not to tåb∂t but to sakßnah andbaqiyyah, and the meaning would thus be that the tranquillity and inspiration were borneby the angels into the heart of Saul. \n\n249a. “The story of Saul is here confounded with that of Gideon” says a Christiancritic. All that the Qur’ån states is that Saul tried his forces by a river, and the Bible doesnot say anything about it. On the other hand, the Bible speaks of a trial of a somewhatsimilar nature by Gideon (Judges 7: 1–6), while the Qur’ån does not speak of Gideon atall. The Qur’ån does not undertake to give a full and detailed history of the Israelites,and no Christian does, I think, hold the belief that the Bible gives a full and detailedrecord of the whole of the Israelite nation, so that it could not have omitted a single incident. Nor is there anything strange if Saul followed the example of Gideon. That theseare two different incidents is made clear by the fact that while Gideon tried his forces by“the well of Harod” (Judges 7: 1), Saul tried his forces by a river, as stated in the Qur’ån.It further appears from the Bible that the river Jordan was there: “Some of the Hebrewswent over Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead” (1 Sam. 13: 7). \n\n249b. The Arabic word is Jål∂t, of the same measure as Ôål∂t, meaning he assailedor assaulted in the battle (LL), and thus instead of Goliath the Holy Qur’ån has adopteda name which expresses his chief characteristic.\n\n249c. Compare 1 Sam. 14: 6: “For there is no restraint to the Lord to save by manyor by few”. And on one occasion only six hundred men were left with him(1 Sam.13: 15). \n\n251a. David was both a king and a prophet. \n\n251b. Thus the Muslims are told that they have to fight to restore order and establishpeace in the country.\n\n253a. The principle is here recognized that some messengers excel others, and itcontains, apparently, a reference to the excellence of the Prophet Muƒammad. The mention of David and Jesus in particular here is to show that, notwithstanding that these twoprophets represented two different aspects of the advancement of the Israelite nation,David standing for their worldly eminence and Jesus for their spiritual eminence, theyboth sang praises of the Holy Prophet Mu√ammad, and both spoke of his advent as the advent of God Himself, thus indicating that, looked at from both standpoints, theexcellence of the Prophet over other prophets was so immeasurable as to have led two ofthe most eminent Israelite prophets to speak of his advent as the coming of the Lord.Numerous verses of the Holy Qur’ån bear testimony to the greatness of the HolyProphet. He is repeatedly spoken of as being endowed with all those qualities ofgreatness in the highest degree which to others were given only partially and in a lessdegree. It is for this reason that the Prophet is declared to be a mercy to all nations(21: 107), and his followers are called the best of the people (3: 110), which shows thathe is the greatest of the prophets.\n\n253b. Allåh spoke to all, but there were some who were exalted above others bymany degrees. Compare this with v. 87: “And some (of the prophets) you gave the lie toand others you would slay”, whereas those whom they tried to kill were also called liars.\n\n254a. The carrying on of the struggle for existence against the numerous enemies ofIslåm required in the first place the raising of funds and other acts of self-sacrifice; hencethe repeated exhortations to spend. The subject is dealt with at length in the two sectionsthat follow the next.\n\n255a. The twofold significance of intercession has been explained in 48b. Theprinciple is here recognized that there may be intercession with Divine permission. It istrue that Islåm does not recognize the doctrine that man stands in need of any mediatorto reconcile him with God, and therefore, mediation or intercession in the sense in whichthe Christian doctrine is held is unknown to Islåm. But there is another aspect of it. TheProphet, to whom the Divine will is revealed, is the Model for his people. He is perfectand by pointing out a way enables others to attain to perfection. In this sense he is calleda shaf ß‘ or an intercessor. Those who take the Prophet for their model may thus attain toperfection. But as all men are not equally gifted, nor have all equal occasion to attain toa state of perfection, though they exert themselves to their utmost, Divine mercy takesthem by the hand and amends are made for such defects through the intercession of theProphet. It is in this sense that Islåm recognizes the doctrine of intercession in the lifeafter death.\n\n255b. Kursß means knowledge. Ibn Jubair said: “His Kursß is His Knowledge”(B. 65:ii,      44). It also means chair or throne, but the word is freely used in Arabic toindicate knowledge or learning, and a learned man is called ahl al-kursß. There is anArabic proverb, khair al-nåsi al-karåsß, which means that the best of men are the men oflearning. See further 7: 54b, where the meaning of ‘arsh is explained. \n\n255c. This is a very well-known verse which goes under the name of åyat al-kursß,or the verse of knowledge, because it deals with the all-comprehensive knowledge ofAllåh. \n\n256a. To all the nonsense which is being talked about the Prophet offering Islåm orthe sword as alternatives to the pagan Arabs, this verse is a sufficient answer. Beingassured of success, the Muslims are told that when they hold the power in their handtheir guiding principle should be that there should be no compulsion in the matter ofreligion. The presumption that this passage was directed to the early converts and that itwas abrogated later on is utterly baseless. \n\n256b. Ôågh∂t is derived from Δaghå, meaning he was inordinate or exorbitant, andis variously explained as meaning “the exorbitant in pride or corruptness or disbelief, ofthe people of the Scriptures, or any head or leader of error, or he who turns from the good, or the idols, or whatever is worshipped to the exclusion of God, or the devil” (LL).As the word devil is freely used for most of the significances of Δagh∂t given above, Ihave adopted it as the significance throughout this translation. But it is not a propername, as it accepts the definite article al. It is used as a plural here, though it has aseparate plural form Δawåghßt. \n\n257a. Faith is here spoken of as light and disbelief as darkness. The contrast isbrought out to the best advantage in 24: 35– 40.\n\n258a. The words “because Allåh had given him kingdom” are taken by the majorityof commentators to refer to Abraham’s opponent whose name is given as Nimrod (Gen.10: 8,      9), but the view of the minority that the personal pronoun him in the abovequotation refers to Abraham is preferable. It is corroborated by 4: 54: “We have given toAbraham’s children the Book and the Wisdom and We have given them a grandkingdom”. Even in Genesis the promised land is spoken of as being given to Abraham:“I am the Lord that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land toinherit it” (Gen. 15: 7). The words åtå-hu-llåhu would in this case mean Allåh hadpromised to give him.The Muslims are here told that just as a promise is given to them that they will beraised to great eminence from the state of insignificance in which they were, which isequivalent to raising the dead to life, a similar promise was given to Abraham, thatpromise being in fact the basis of the present promise to the Prophet: see 124a. \n\n258b. It is not stated what it was to which the giving of life or bringing of deathrelates, but as the discussion arose out of the promise given to Abraham that his descendants would be made a great nation, it is clear that the reference here is to the life anddeath of nations. It should be noted that the words √ayåt and maut, literally life anddeath, are as well applicable to nations and places as to men, animals and vegetation.Thus måtati-l-ar˙u signifies the land became destitute of vegetation and inhabitants(LL). What is stated here is further illustrated in the verse that follows by the Divinepromise as to the rebuilding of Jerusalem, where the desolation of the sacred city is spoken of as its death and its rebuilding is called its life.\n\n258c. The disputant belonged to a race of sun-worshippers, and therefore when heclaimed that he could give life and cause death, Abraham advanced an argument whichquite confounded his adversary. If he could give life and cause death he could controleven his deity, the sun, for to give life and cause death were the work of the deity andnot of the devotee, and hence he could make it rise from the opposite direction. Theadversary was confounded, because he saw that he had made an assertion which wasopposed to his own avowed belief. \n\n259a. An illustration is afforded here from later Israelite history, as to how deadnations are raised to life. By “the town which had fallen in upon its roofs” is meantJerusalem (Rz, AH), as it was left after its desolation by Nebuchadnezzar in 599 B.C.The words “look at the bones, how We set them together, then clothe them withflesh”, undoubtedly refer to Ezekiel’s vision as related in Ezekiel, ch. 37. The first partof ch. 37 relates how Ezekiel was taken (in a vision) “in the midst of the valley whichwas full of bones,” and asked, “Son of man, can these bones live?” After a Divine assurance, Ezekiel is made to witness the scene which is narrated here in the words — Look at the bones, how We set them together: “The bones came together, bone to his bone,”and “the sinews and the flesh came upon them, and the skin covered them above,” andthen “the breath came into them, and they lived” (Ezek. 37: 1–10). That what is narratedin Ezekiel, ch. 37, is a vision is clear from the introductory words of that chapter: “Thehand of the Lord was upon me, and carried me out in the spirit of the Lord”. Whatfollows the incident makes it still more clear, for verse 11 (Ezekiel, ch. 37) goes on tosay: “Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel: Behold, they say, Ourbones are dried, and our hope is lost”; while verse 12 gives them the Divine promise,“Behold, O My people, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of yourgraves, and bring you into the land of Israel”. This shows conclusively that the boneswere only a symbol of the fallen condition of the whole house of Israel. I lay stress uponthe word whole in Ezekiel 37: 11, because the actual bones were only of the very fewamong them who were put to the sword, by far the greater number being in captivity orheld in a slavish condition in subjugation to the Babylonians.The identical incident related in v. 259 is also a vision. The Qur’ån usually dispenses with words showing an incident to be a vision when either the context or the nature ofthe incident or a reference to earlier history makes it clear that it is a vision. Comparethe words in which Joseph narrated his vision to his father in 12: 4: “O my father, I saweleven stars and the sun and the moon — I saw them making obeisance to me,” notmaking any mention at all that he had seen this in a vision. In the verse under discussion, however, it is not only its identity with Ezekiel 37: 1–10 that shows the incident tobe a vision, but the insertion of a kåf, signifying likeness, before the whole is a furtherindication of the same. If the incident had been a real one, as in the previous verse, theverse should have commenced with the words or him instead of or like him, the insertionof the kåf giving the incident the colour of a parable or a vision.The causing the prophet to die for a hundred years is also an incident of the visionwhich, though not narrated in the Bible, is corroborated by facts, standing symbolicallyfor the death of the Jewish nation, a death of disgrace and sorrow, or the desolation ofJerusalem, which covered a period of almost a hundred years. Jerusalem was taken byNebuchadnezzar in 599 B.C. (2 Kings 24: 10); Cyrus gave permission to rebuild the temple in 537 B.C. (Ezra 1: 2), the house being eventually finished in 515 B.C. (Ezra 6: 15).The Bible does not give us the history of the period from 515 B.C., and even if we arenot allowed to conjecture that another fifteen years may have been taken by the Israelitesto settle back in Jerusalem and to rebuild the city itself for their own habitation, the period from 599 to 515 B.C. covers almost fully the whole of the sixth century B.C., andhence the hundred years of the prophet’s death in this vision represent the hundred yearsof the death of the Israelite nation.The reference to the food and drink of the prophet, which did not show anyinfluence of years, and to his ass, which was still standing by, only proves that the hundred years’ death which the prophet underwent was only a vision. The mention of thebones has been taken by some commentators to refer to the ass, but this is an obviouserror, for the two statements are separated by a sentence: “And that We may make thee asign to men”; and there is also a pause after the word ass, separating what follows fromthat which has preceded.How was Ezekiel a sign to the people? Because the vision made him a symbol ofthe whole Jewish nation, and his symbolic death for a hundred years represented the sorrows and afflictions of Israel for a similar period, after which they were once more tobe restored to life.The word yatasannah (sanah, a year) means the thing underwent the lapse of years.The word applied to food and drink carries a similar significance, meaning it becamealtered (for the worse) by the lapse of years (LA, LL). Rz explains the lapse of years tobe the real meaning of the word, for his explanation is the years did not pass over it.This shows that actually there was no lapse of years, and it is simply a vision. \n\n260a. This verse is a natural sequel to v. 258, which speaks of the manifestation ofAllåh’s power in the life and death of nations. Verse 259, as already noted, has beeninterposed to afford a proof of the assertion made in v. 258. In Gen. 15: 8 Abraham ismade to say, after receiving a promise of the land of Canaan: “Lord God, whereby shallI know that I shall inherit it?” The Quranic parallel to this is: “My Lord, show me howThou givest life to the dead.” He believed in the Divine promise, and was so sure of itthat he had even contended with and overcome an adversary on this point. But was it notstrange that out of his seed should arise a nation that should supplant the powerfulnations that ruled the land? The sign given to Abraham according to Gen. 15: 9–11 isquite meaningless, not making it clear how Abraham’s seed was to inherit the land. Heis told to take “a heifer of three years old, and a she-goat of three years old, and a ram ofthree years old, and a turtle-dove, and a young pigeon”; he “divided them in the midst.”“And when the fowls came down upon the carcasses, Abraham drove them away.” Howthis was a sign of Abraham inheriting the land of Canaan is a mystery. It only shows thatthe text here has been tampered with.The answer to Abraham’s how as given in the Qur’ån is a perfectly intelligibleparable. If he should take four birds and tame them, they would obey his call and fly tohim even from the distant mountains. If the birds, then, obey his call, he being neithertheir master nor the author of their existence, would not nations submit to the call oftheir Divine Master and the Author of their existence? Or if the birds, being only tamedfor a short time by a man who had otherwise no control over them, become so obedientto their tamer, has not Allåh the power to control all those causes which govern the lifeand death of nations? Whenever He wishes to destroy a people He brings about thecauses of their decline and evil fortune overtakes them; and when He wishes to make apeople prosperous He brings about causes which result in their rise and progress. Thatthe word Δå’ir (plural Δair is used here) which signifies a bird, also signifies the cause ofgood and evil, or misery or happiness (T, LL), in which sense the word is used in 7: 131and elsewhere in the Holy Qur’ån, is a further indication of the significance of theparable of the birds, through which Abraham is made to realize how the Almightycontrols the fortunes of nations. It is an error to suppose that Abraham actually took fourbirds and tamed them. The Qur’ån does not say so. It only makes Abraham realize thewonderful manifestation of Divine power by a parable.The lexicologists are all agreed that the word ©ur, used here, is the imperative form of©åra, wich means he made it to incline (LL), and ©ur-hunna ilaika means amil-hunna, ormake them incline, wa ajmi‘-hunna, and gather them to thee (LA). It is only in this sensethat the word is followed by ilå as here. Cutting into pieces is not the significance of thesewords. Further, the words place a part (juz‘) of them can only mean one each of the fourbirds. The commentators who introduce the story of cutting the birds into pieces, nottraceable to any reliable authority, assert that the words thumma qaΔΔi‘-hunna (then cut theminto pieces) are omitted here after ©ur hunna or tame them which is absurd on the face of it. \n\n261a. The primary object of this and the following section in exhorting the faithfulto spend money is the advancement of the cause of Islåm, though other objects ofcharity are also included. The primary significance of the words f ß sabßl Allåh (in theway of Allåh) is the cause of the Faith or the cause of Truth. This is made clear in 9: 60,where f ß sabßl Allåh is a head of expenditure in addition to helping the needy, etc.\n\n261b. The comparison of money spent in the cause of Truth to a grain yieldingincrease is to show: firstly, that the progress of Islåm depended on the sacrifices whichthe individual members of the community made; and secondly, that the expenditure ofmoney must be accompanied with hard labour, as a seed cast on ground unaccompaniedby any labour would not grow. It is noteworthy that while the Qur’ån represents theincrease to be seven-hundredfold, even multiples of it, Jesus, in a similar parable — theparable of the sower — promises thirty, sixty or a hundredfold increase (Matt.13: 23;Mark 4: 8). \n\n262a. Mann is originally the conferring of a benefit or a favour upon one (LL), andis so used in the Holy Qur’ån frequently; it also has a secondary meaning, i.e., givingexpression to the good done to anybody (Rz), or, reminding one of the favour done byway of reproach, and this is the meaning here. Adhå signifies harm or annoyance, byspeaking evilly of one or inflicting slight injury. Gifts, whether given in the cause ofnational or individual suffering, must not be accompanied by any interested motives;hence the donor is forbidden even to mention them afterwards.\n\n264a. The expression conveys a very strong disapproval of giving alms to be seenby men. It does not simply forbid the giving of alms “before men to be seen of them”(Matt. 6: 1), but speaks of this as being the work of those “who believe not in Allåh andthe Last Day,” by which are meant the disbelievers, thus making it utterly hateful in thesight of true believers. \n\n264b. The concluding words of the parable show that the efforts of the disbelieversto deal a death-blow to Islåm are meant here. They were spending their money to retardthe advancement of Islåm, but their efforts, they are told, would be fruitless; compare8:36. The words they are not able to gain anything of that which they earn leave nodoubt as to its purport. \n\n265a. This is the parable of the believers who will reap the fruits of the sacrifices theymake. They are spoken of as spending to seek Allåh’s pleasure, because all their effortswere for the upholding of truth, and for the strengthening of their souls, every act of selfsacrifice being due to their certainty of the ultimate triumph of the Truth, which in its turngave them strength to make still greater sacrifices. The word Δall means slight rain, or dew.\n\n266a. With great sacrifices during thirteen years at Makkah, the Muslims had builtup a community to carry the message of the Truth to the world. But now when they had found a shelter at Madßnah and were making good progress, they were being attacked byan enemy who aimed at destroying them altogether. The Muslims were, therefore, nowcalled upon to make still greater sacrifices to save the garden of Islåm from being blasted, and to put their whole strength, their lives as well as their wealth, into the cause.\n\n267a. The Muslims are here enjoined to support the cause of Truth by spendinggood things, things which they love, and not to even think of giving bad things, thingswhich they themselves would not accept from others. Elsewhere it is said: “You cannotattain to righteousness unless you spend out of what you love” (3: 92). They are thustold that half-hearted support brings no good either to the cause or to the helper of thecause; what is required is that they should exert themselves to their utmost and supportthe cause whole-heartedly. \n\n268a. Fa√shå’ here signifies niggardliness or tenaciousness, being equivalent tobukhl (LL). \n\n271a. The manifesting of charity or giving alms openly is a thing quite differentfrom giving them “to be seen of men”, for which see v. 264. By the giving of charityopenly is meant the giving of subscriptions for works of public utility or for nationaldefence, or for the advancement of national or public welfare. The teaching of theGospels (Matt. 6: 1–4) lays all the stress upon private acts of charity, and makes nomention at all of subscriptions for works of public utility and for organized efforts fordealing with the poor, without which national growth is impossible. The rule laid downhere takes into consideration the varying circumstances of human society and enjoinspublic as well as private acts of charity, mentioning public charity first, as that is ofgreatest importance. \n\n272a. The opening words of the verse call attention to the special difficulties ofMuslim society, which was required to repel its enemies in the interests of its existence.It shows that the Muslims did not fight to bring the disbelievers into the fold of Islåm;for that, the Prophet is told in plain words, was not his responsibility. It was for the goodof their people, the defence of the Muslim community that the Muslims were required toraise subscriptions. Hence what they spent was for Allåh’s pleasure, because it was inthe cause of truth. In the concluding words they are assured that for these deeds of sacrifice they will be fully rewarded.As regards private charity, reports mentioned under this verse show that Muslimcharity was exercised not only for the welfare of their own co-religionists but also forthat of the disbelievers and that Islåm did not allow the difference of religion to be ahindrance to the bestowal of charity upon a deserving person.\n\n273a. The first qualification of those who deserve charity is that they are confined inthe way of Allåh. Among these are included: (1) Those who had to fight in defence ofIslåm, but had no means of livelihood; (2) those who could not go forth to trade becauseof the insecurity of the roads and the constant raids of the enemy; (3) those who werewounded in the fighting (Rz). \n\n273b. In translating ˙arb-an fi-l-ar˙ as “knocking about in the land ”, Palmer hasmade a mistake. The unhappy similarity which he discovered between the colloquialEnglish phrase “knock about”, which means “to wander here and there in a rough, careless, and aimless way”, and one of the significances of the Arabic word ˙arb, viz.,beating, striking, or smiting, makes him draw the conclusion that the “language of theQur’ån is really rude and rugged”. He would have been nearer the mark if he had saidbeating the land. As a matter of fact, the phrase here used means he journeyed in theland, seeking sustenance and for the purpose of traffic (LL). \n\n273c. Here we have another qualification of those who deserve to be assisted byprivate acts of charity; these are the men who abstain from begging. This would showthat the Holy Qur’ån does not countenance the practice of begging from door to door. \n\n274a. It is a prophetic assurance to the Muslims that if they made sacrifices for thenational welfare, the fear of annihilation under which the Muslim community then livedwould be dispelled, and they would not grieve for what they spent, as it would yieldabundant fruit. This is, in fact, a prophecy of their final triumph over their enemies, forthe party that is victorious in a struggle does not grieve for the sacrifices that it makeswhile the vanquished party does. \n\n275a. Ribå (literally, an excess or addition) means an addition over and above theprincipal sum that is lent (R, T, LL), and includes usury as well as interest. The subjectis introduced here very appropriately, for as charity is the broad basis of human sympathy, usury annihilates all sympathetic affection and leads to the extreme of miserliness.Thus from one point of view the subject of usury stands in contrast with that of charity,while from another point of view the connection between these two subjects is, as pointed out in the two preceding sections and the verse with which this section opens, that,while the Muslims were promised great wealth and prosperity, they were warned againstan inordinate desire for amassing wealth, to which usury would certainly have led them.Hence, those who devour usury are compared with those prostrated by the touch of the devil, which in this case stands for Mammon. The prohibition of usury in Islåm is a verywide subject, and cannot be discussed within the limits of a footnote. But it may benoted in passing that Islåm adopts the golden mean in all cases. It does not go to theextreme of the socialistic idea which aims at the annihilation of all distinction of property rights, but it establishes institutions which give the poor a certain proportion of theriches of the wealthier members of society. Such is the institution of zakåt, according towhich one-fortieth of the amassed wealth of every member of society is taken yearly tobe distributed among the poor. Hence zakåt is particularly spoken of in connection withthis subject in v. 277. In perfect accordance with that institution, Islåm refused to allowthe rich to grow richer by reducing the poor to still greater poverty, which is the real aimof usury. Usury, moreover, promotes habits of idleness; but its worst effect is on morals,as it causes man to be obsessed by love of wealth and selfishness; and this is, in fact,what is meant by the devil prostrating a devourer of usury.It may also be mentioned in this connection that while Islåm enjoins acts of sacrificeto carry on the struggle for national existence, it prohibits usurious dealings which arethe basis of modern warfare. All wars are now carried on with the help of loans, intereston which ultimately is a source of ruin to both the conquerers and the conquered. A justwar, a war in self-defence, would always lead a community to acts of sacrifice to whichthey would be impelled in the interest of their own existence, while an aggressive warcan only be carried on by heavy loans whose burden is not felt at the time but whichultimately crush the community. \n\n275b. The Qur’ån draws a distinction between trading and usury. In trade thecapitalist takes the risk of loss along with the hope of profit, but in lending money onusury the whole of the loss is suffered by the man who uses his labour, while thecapitalist may count upon his profit even in the case of loss in the actual concern. Hencetrading stands on quite a different footing from usury. It may be added that in the greatstruggle between capital and labour, Islåm sides with labour. If labour does not bringprofit, the capitalist should suffer along with the labourer. \n\n275c. Here is a prohibition to receive any interest on money lent, but if anyone hadactually received any interest before the prohibition he was not required to pay it back. \n\n276a. Ma√aqa signifies he took away the blessing thereof or he diminished it (R). Italso signifies the blotting out or annihilating of a thing. Usury is here condemned, whilecharitable deeds are commended as being the real source of the prosperity of a nation orof humanity in general. It is a prophetic reference to the general tendency in the growthof civilization to lessening rates of interest, so much so that usurious dealings, in the proper sense of the word, are becoming almost extinct, while the tendency for publiccharity or personal sacrifice in the interests of a community, or even humanity in general, is daily gaining ground. \n\n278a. The balance of interest which might be due at the time when the prohibitionwas made known must be given up. \n\n279a. Going directly against the commandments of Allåh is here described as a warwith Allåh and His Messenger. The money received as bank interest may be spent in thecause of Allåh and His Messenger or for the propagation of Islåm, and thus from a warwith Allåh and His Messenger it would be converted into a war for Allåh and HisMessenger. In fact the Divine purpose in the prohibition of interest is fulfilled if interestis changed into charity. \n\n279b. The meaning is that the debtor shall not be made to pay more than the sum lent. \n\n280a. This indicates the kind of sympathy Islåm demands. The poor man is not tobe prosecuted and thrown into prison, and payment of debt must be postponed till thedebtor is able to pay, or, better still, the whole may be remitted as charity. \n\n282a. The subject of usury, which is connected with the lending and borrowing ofmoney and trading in general, brings us to the subject of contracts. If Islåm enjoinscharity and prohibits usury, it requires at the same time that the greatest precautionsmust be taken for safeguarding property rights. A noteworthy thing about this is that theArabs were quite an ignorant people, among whom writing was very rare. Even thenthey were required to put down all their transactions, great or small, in writing, except inhand-to-hand dealings.\n\n282b. These words form the basis of the guardian and ward law, as they point outwhen a guardian may be appointed for one who is not able to manage his own property.The word which I have translated as weak really signifies one too young (i.e. a minor) orone too old (Bd). Thus a guardian may be appointed not only when the owner is a minor,but also when his understanding is not sound on account of age or any other reason.\n\n282c. As women did not take much part in business, and were therefore unable tounderstand the transaction, two women are required instead of one man. \n\n282d. The personal pronoun humå may refer either to the testimony of the twowitnesses or the two women. Reminding here stands for making up the deficiency of theother’s memory.The Holy Qur’ån does not say that no case should be decided except on the testi -mony of two witnesses, but requires ordinarily the calling of two witnesses at the time ofthe transaction, so that the deficiency of one may be rectified by the other. Cases may be decided on circumstantial evidence as well, which is sometimes stronger than theevidence of witnesses. The Holy Qur’ån itself speaks of Joseph’s innocence beingestablished on circumstantial evidence (12: 26,      27). \n\n282e. They must not be made to suffer loss in their own business. In other words,their convenience must be kept in view, and they should be paid. \n\n283a. This does not mean that a security cannot be taken in any other case. On theother hand, the words that follow show that security may be taken when the lender doesnot trust the debtor.It further shows that advantage can be derived by the lender from the movable orimmovable property which has been given into his possession as a security for the debt.Thus land mortgaged for a debt may be cultivated, or house-property may be rented orused. This is made clear in a saying of the Prophet: “The mortgaged animal may be usedfor riding, when it is mortgaged, on account of what is spent on it, and the milk of themilch animal may be drunk when it is mortgaged, and the expenditure shall be borne byhim who rides (the animal) and drinks the milk” (B. 48: 4).\n\n284a. This verse has generally been misunderstood. It does not signify “Allåh willcall you to account for it”, but that “He will call you to account according to it”; so thathe who hides (i.e. keeps under control) his evil inclinations and he who manifests (i.e.gives vent to them) shall not be dealt with in the same manner, but according to theirdeserts. Almost the same statement is contained in 3: 29, where it is said: “Say: Whetheryou hide what is in your hearts or manifest it, Allåh knows it”. Evil thoughts are notunpunishable; but evil inclinations which a man keeps suppressed, and which thereforegradually disappear, cannot be included in the category of evil thoughts; it is these thatare meant here. \n\n285a. The breadth of the Muslim faith, which has been dealt with on severaloccasions in this chapter, is again mentioned in reference to the triumph of the Muslims;for even if the Muslims were triumphant, their religion could not triumph over otherreligions unless established on very broad principles which should commend themselvesto all. The triumph of the Muslim religion, it is hinted, would not be due to politicalsupremacy but to the excellence and breadth of its principles. Hence, even in these daysof Muslim political decadence, Islåm is making spiritual conquests. This is no doubt dueto the breadth of its principles. \n\n286a. Some of the words in which these prayers are addressed require to beexplained. I©r means a burden which restrains one from motion, and, therefore, theburden of sin, as sin hampers the spiritual progress of man and restrains him fromadvancing spiritually. U‘fu is from ‘afw, which means effacing or obliteration (R), andgenerally indicates the effacing or pardoning of sins. Ighfir is from ghafr, which meanscovering with that which protects a thing from dirt (R). In religious terminology, theword ghafr is used, as Barmåwß explains in QasΔalånß (commentary of Bukhårß), asmeaning protection which, he says, is of two kinds, protecting man from the commissionof sin or protecting him from the punishment of a sin that he has committed. This is inaccordance with what is said in the Nihåyah where the Divine attributes Ghåfir andGhaf∂r are explained as meaning One Who protects men from the commission of sinsand faults and One Who passes over their sins and faults — Al-Såtiru li-dhun∂bi ‘ibådihß wa ‘uy∂bi-him al-mutajåwizu ‘an khaΔåyå-hum wa dhun∂bi-him.It may be noted here that as a preliminary to the prayer for victory over the dis -believers, there is one set of three petitions in the first part of the verse and another set ofthree petitions in the second part. The first three petitions made to God are punish us not,lay not on us the burden of sins, impose not on us afflictions which we have not thestrength to bear. Corresponding to these three petitions respectively are the threepetitions in the second part, pardon us, grant us protection, have mercy on us. Thuscorresponding to the desire to be saved from punishment is the petition that God maypardon His servant whatever faults he has committed; corresponding to the desire thatone may not be burdened with sins is the petition that one may be granted protectionfrom the commission of sins; and corresponding to the desire to be saved from afflictions which one has not the strength to bear is the petition for the mercy of God.It is further necessary to remember that the two words ‘afw and ghafr and theirderivatives, and the two corresponding Divine attributes ‘Ufuww and Ghaf∂r, are of veryfrequent occurrence in the Holy Qur’ån, and they are generally taken as meaningpardoning and forgiving, but there is really a fine distinction between the significance ofthe two, as pointed out above. And when the two words are used together as here, ‘afwalways implies the pardoning of sins so that one may be saved from the punishmentwhich the commission of sin brings and ghafr protection from the commission of sin.Istighfår is thus really a prayer for sinlessness.This, the concluding prayer of this chapter, is given very great importance in theProphet’s sayings. According to the √adßth, “whoever prays as taught in the last twoverses of the Baqarah, they are sufficient for him” (B. 64: 12).It is noteworthy that if the Muslims are taught to pray for victory over disbelievers,they are at the same time taught to be humble and forgiving. What a spirit of humilitydoes the Holy Word breathe even in the hour of triumph! The aspiration of the soul to beled to the promised victory is still subjected to the holier yearnings of the soul.The end of the chapter shows that the triumph of Islåm is its real object, and this isplainly outlined in the opening and closing sections of the chapter."
