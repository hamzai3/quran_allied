      "note": "5a. Note that the coverings of the hearts, the deafness of the ears and the hanging ofthe veils are used simply to indicate their own determined rejection of the Truth. Theyresolved neither to open their hearts, lest the Truth should enter them, nor to lend theirears so that they might even hear the preaching of the Prophet. In fact, it was their ownact which brought about that consequence.\n\n10a. For the creation of the heavens and the earth in six days, see 7:54a; the day infact stands for a stage in growth. The making of the earth in two days and the making onit of the mountains, rivers and of plant and animal life in four days is really one continuous process, there being six days or six stages in all. The first stage is the throwing off ofthe cosmic matter called the earth; the second stage is the cooling of its surface; the thirdis the making of the mountains; the fourth is that of blessing it by waters and making init rivers; the fifth and the sixth stages are spoken of as the ordaining of foods, being, inthe first place, the growth of plant life and, in the second, the growth of animal life, culminating in the creation of man. That the creation in six days does not refer to the timeactually taken in making the heavens and the earth, which is still going on, is noted evenby the earlier commentators.\n\n10b. The meaning of this passage is that the foods which are made in the earth areequally accessible to all seekers.\n\n11a. Note that heaven is here plainly spoken of as being originally dukhån, smoke,vapour or gaseous matter. The command to creation to come willingly or unwillingly isa reference to the Divine laws working in nature. Everything created, whether in theheavens or the earth, is subject to law. The existence of one law throughout the universeis clear evidence of the existence of One God, the Maker of that law.\n\n12a. Just as, about the earth, it is stated in v. 9 that it was created in two days or intwo stages, we are told here about the heavenly bodies that they, too, were created intwo days or two stages. The creation of heavenly bodies is thus subject to the same law.For the seven heavens, see 2:29b. The words that follow — and revealed in every heaven its affair — show that everything created in nature serves a purpose.\n\n12b. See 37:7a.\n\n13a. The first 13 verses of this chapter were recited by the Holy Prophet when‘Utbah ibn Rabß‘ah came to him with a message from the Quraish. The message was tothe effect that the Prophet should discontinue speaking ill of their gods and condemningtheir ways, and then they would be willing to make him their chief, or give him the mostbeautiful woman in marriage, or collect wealth for him. When ‘Utbah had delivered hismessage, the Prophet read these verses; but when he reached v. 13, warning theMakkans of the fate of ‘Åd and Tham∂d, ‘Utbah entreated him to speak no more, andwent back to the Quraish to make known to them the Prophet’s reply (Rz).\n\n14a. The coming of the prophets from before and behind signifies their impressingthe truth of their message upon their people in every possible way. Some understand thecoming of the prophets from near and from far (JB).\n\n16a. The Quraish are warned in these words of an abasing punishment in this life,and a still more abasing punishment in the Hereafter. Their unlucky days were the daysof drought.\n\n17a. ‘Amå (blindness) is metaphorically used in relation to the mind, as meaningerring; the connection between the two meanings being the not finding or not taking theright way or the being blind in respect of the mind (LL).\n\n20a. The bearing of witness by the ears and the eyes and the skin shows the truth ofthe law that the consequences of evil deeds will become manifest.\n\n24a. God’s goodwill can be gained in this life, and for those who waste that opportunity here the only way to that goodwill is to go through the ordeal of Fire.\n\n25a. These comrades are wicked companions.\n\n31a. Vv. 30 and 31 show that it is in this life that the angels descend upon the faithful, giving them the joyful news that they should not have any fear. In fact, it is here,when the faithful are persecuted and oppressed, and when the powers of evil seem tohave the upper hand, that such assurances are most needed, and it is here that the angelsgive them comfort and strength to bear hardships, and thus they ultimately overcome theforces of evil.\n\n36a. The previous verse teaches the repelling of evil with good. This verse suggestsanother remedy for evil. The primary significance of nazagha-h∂ is he charged him withvice or spoke evil of him (T). It is in this sense that the word is used here and the contextmakes it clear. It is also used in this sense in 7:200; see 7:200a. It also means intrusionon or interference in an affair for the purpose of causing mischief in it (R), and the wordis used in this sense in 12:100. The Prophet is here told that, if his work is interfered withby evildoers or if false imputations are made against him, he should seek refuge in Allåh,and Divine help, which always comes to the righteous, will make truth triumphant.\n\n38a. The recitation of this verse is followed by an actual prostration; see 7:206a.\n\n39a. The still earth signifies land dried up and without herbage; its stirring indicatesits moving with life and its swelling the producing of herbage. This is entirely metaphorical. It indicates that, when Divine revelation comes, it gives a new life to men.Attention is called to this in the words that follow. The effect of rain upon earth islikened to the effect of the Qur’ån upon the hearts of men. Dead here are the spirituallydead.\n\n44a. There seems to be a reference here to the prophecies which spoke of the coming of an Ishmaelite or an Arab prophet. The reference to Moses in the next verseconfirms this, because Moses spoke plainly of a prophet like himself appearing fromamong the brethren of the Israelites, who are no others than the Ishmaelites. \n\n44b. The Qur’ån is here called a healing because it was a remedy for the spiritualdiseases which prevailed in the world. It is the book which proved itself to be a healing,because it found a nation affected with the worst possible spiritual and moral diseases,and within less than a quarter of a century cleansed a whole country and a whole nationof all those diseases. Its healing effect, however, has not been limited to Arabia, andtoday there is no people on the surface of the earth that does not bear witness to the greathealing power of the Qur’ån, which is so far-reaching in its effect that non-Muslimshave benefited by it equally with Muslims.\n\n50a. The words indicate man’s ungratefulness for Divine blessings. He does not recognize Divine goodness in those gifts, but says “this is due to me”, i.e., I have obtainedit by my own exertion and I deserve it. And then he denies the Judgment.\n\n53a. The word åf åq means borders or extremeties of the earth, or its remote sides, andthe great message conveyed here is that Islåm will spread to the most distant regions of theearth — anfusi-him denoting their own people, or the Arabs. What is stated here is this thatIslåm will quickly spread, not only in Arabia but in the remote regions of the earth, andthis prophecy is contained in a chapter revealed early at Makkah, when Muslims werebeing severely persecuted and the message of Islåm had apparently little hope of findingacceptance anywhere. If the prophecy is so clear, its fulfilment is clearer still. Within twenty years of its birth, Islåm spread through the whole of Arabia, and within a hundred years,it reached the farthest regions of the earth, both in the East and the West. Both the prophecy and its fulfilment are thus two of the most amazing facts of history."
