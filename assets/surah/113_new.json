      "note": "1a. Falaq signifies the daybreak (LL), meaning primarily cleaving or splitting, the daybreak being so called because it cleaves through the darkness. Hence it comes to signify the plain appearing of the Truth after its having been dubious (T, LL). The reference in the Lord of the dawn is to the gradual manifestation of the Truth and its ultimate triumph. \n\n3a. G̲h̲āsiq is derived from g̲h̲asaq, which signifies intense darkness (R). Hence it means darkness in which there is no ray of light, and stands for the dark difficulties with which an affair is sometimes attended — difficulties through which a man is unable to see his way. Man is, therefore, here taught to pray that his affairs may not be enveloped in utter darkness.\n\n4a. Naffāt̲h̲āt is the plural of naffāt̲h̲, which is an intensive nominative from nafat̲h̲a, meaning primarily he blew. But nafat̲h̲a fī qalbi-hī means he put a thing into his heart (LL), and nafat̲h̲a fī rū‘ī means he inspired or put it into my mind (N). ‘Uqadis the plural of ‘uqdah, which signifies a tie (LL), and judgment and consideration of one’s affairs (T), and management, regulating and ordering of one’s affairs (LL). It also signifies a promise of obedience or vow of allegiance (LA, LL). Hence the naffāt̲h̲āt fi l-‘uqad are really those who put evil suggestions into the resolution of men or into the management of their affairs. Note that naffāt̲h̲āt are not necessarily women; the word equally applies to jamā‘āt, or companies of men (Rz).This verse deals with the second difficulty in the management of an affair. The first difficulty is its being enveloped in utter gloom (v. 3); the second is that darkness is dispelled, but the resolution to accomplish the affair is yet weak.\n\n5a. This is the third difficulty. Success is now in sight, but there are those who envy that success. Therefore, Divine protection has still to be sought when a man is successful in accomplishing an affair.Note that the Prophet, who was charged with the heavy task of establishing truth in the world and making it triumphant over falsehood, had to face all these difficulties, and his faithful followers, whose goal of life is the same as that of the Prophet, stand most in need of resorting to this prayer with which the Holy Qur’ān draws to a close."
