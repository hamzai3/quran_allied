	  "note": "1a. Quraish is the name given to the tribe descended from Na˙r ibn Kanånah.According to some the word Quraish is the diminutive of qarsh, a big animal of the sea,which eats others but is not itself eaten. The Quraish were settled at Makkah and hadcharge of the Sacred House, to which pilgrims resorted from all parts of Arabia, and therefore, being guardians of the Holy House, they enjoyed special honour among the tribes ofArabia. Moreover Makkah had thus become the centre of Arabia, bringing prosperity tothe Quraish.The first verse of this chapter is connected with the last chapter, the significance beingthat the Divine protection of the Ka‘bah and the destruction of its enemies was a specialfavour granted to the Quraish, for it led to their protection. It is a fact that, as stated in thelast chapter, being guardians of the Ka‘bah, they were respected when they set out on theirjourneys, while within the sacred territory they enjoyed an unparalleled security.\n\n2a. The protection mentioned in the last note was of special use to them in their journeys northward to Syria and southward to Yaman, the former of which was undertaken inthe summer and the latter in winter, to carry on their trade.\n\n\n4a. Feeding against hunger and granting security against fear were the two specialfavours conferred on the Quraish through the sacredness of the Ka‘bah, because thepilgrimage gave a special impetus to their trade and the necessaries of life were brought totheir very doors, while they were totally secure from all fear of attack, to which the otherArab tribes were constantly exposed."
