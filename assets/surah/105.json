	  "note": "1a. The reference is to the memorable invasion of Makkah by Abrahah, the Christianviceroy in Yaman of the King of Abyssinia. Abrahah’s object was to destroy the Ka‘bahso as to divert Arab religious enthusiasm and Arab trade to ˝an‘å, where he had built amagnificent cathedral for the purpose. This army is known in Arabia as the a©√åb al-Fßl,or the possessors of the Elephant, because of the presence in it of one or more elephants.The year in which the invasion took place is known as the year of the Elephant, being theyear 570 of the Christian era, and coinciding with the year of the Holy Prophet’s birth.Unable to defend the Holy House against the huge army, ‘Abd al-MuΔΔalib thus prayedaloud, leaning upon the door of the Ka‘bah: “Defend, O Lord, Thine own House! and suffer not the Cross to triumph over the Ka‘bah” (Zurqånß). Then the whole population ofMakkah repaired to the hills around the Holy City. Meanwhile a virulent form of smallpox, or some other pestilence, broke out in Abrahah’s army with such severity that thearmy retreated “in confusion and dismay”, many of them, being unable to find their wayback, perishing in the valleys, while a part was swept away by floods (Muir’s Life ofMu√ammad, Introduction, p. c.). There seems to be also an allusion to the circumstancethat, in protecting the Ka‘bah against an enemy, though idols were worshipped there atthe time, Almighty God had shown a purpose in its preservation. The coincidence of thisyear with the year of the Prophet’s birth no doubt furnishes the key to that purpose,because the Arabs not only knew that the Sacred House had Abraham’s blessing, but also that Abraham had prayed for the appearance of a prophet from among them who shouldpurify the House. The mention of the incident thus conveyed a warning to the Quraishthat, if the Lord had destroyed an army on account of its intention to demolish His SacredHouse, would He leave those alone who wanted to destroy His Prophet?\n\n5a. There is no authentic √adßth as to how Abrahah’s army was destroyed. Accordingto ‘Ikrimah, everyone at whom a stone was flung was affected with small-pox (RM). Areport from Ya‘q∂b to the same effect is narrated by Ibn Kathßr. Thus it was a virulentsmall-pox that broke out in the invading army while yet a little distance from Makkah,and the result was that Abrahah himself being affected with the pestilence, the wholearmy fled in a state of confusion, leaving the corpses of the dead for the birds to feast on.The words tarmß-him bi-√ijårat-in may mean the birds cast at them stones or flung themagainst stones, the reference in the latter case being to the birds tearing off flesh fromtheir bodies. For √ijårat-in min sijjßl, see 11:82c. For birds as indicating the destructionof an enemy, see 16:79a."
