    {
      "note": "1a. The last two chapters opened with a warning of the approach of judgment. This,      as a fitting sequel, opens with a declaration of the triumph of the believers, for it was possible that the wicked should have tasted punishment without resultant good to the faithful.      To dispel all such doubts it is stated that the believers shall be successful even in this life.\n\n      4a. Få‘il∂n (from fi‘l, doing) means doers of deeds, and li-l-zakåt means for the sake      of purity or to attain purity. The word zakåt means originally purity, as in 19:13, while      zakåt in the sense of poor-rate is spoken of as being paid, yu‘t∂n al-zakåt — they pay      zakåt, being always the form adopted. Hence the significance adopted here — they do      what they do for the sake of, or to attain to, purity.\n\n      5a. Fur∂j, plural of farj, indicates the part of a person which it is indecent to expose      (LL), particularly the pudenda. In this sense √if˚ al-farj means generally the observing of      continence, or the restraining of sexual passions.      6a. The words au må malakat aimånu-hum, of which a literal rendering is given in the      translation, usually indicate slaves. It should be noted that this chapter is a Makkan revelation, and the conditions under which slave-girls could be taken as wives were given later at      Madßnah; see 4:25a. If the reference here is to sexual relations, the permission regarding      those whom their right hands possess must be read subject to the conditions of 4:25. It      may be added that slave-girls, when taken as wives, did not acquire the full status of a free      wife, and hence they are spoken of distinctly. It may, however, be added that √if˚ al-farj in      a wider sense means the covering of parts of the body which it is indecent to expose, and in      this connection it must be borne in mind that according to Islamic rules of decency, the      exposure of such parts of the body, as are generally exposed in ballrooms and theatres, is      disallowed, but a certain degree of freedom is allowed to women in the presence of their      husbands and female servants and to men in the presence of their wives and male servants. \n\n      12a. The creation of man is here traced back to earth, for the life-germ in sperma is      an extract of food, which is drawn from earth in whatever form it may be. It should be      noted that while the first ten verses speak of the spiritual growth of man, his physical      growth is here spoken of, and thus a comparison may be established between the physical and the spiritual growth. Though described in the past tense, it is a general law of the      creation of man that is spoken of here. The addition of the words, then We cause it to      grow into another creation (v. 14), is to show that man’s creation does not end with the      completion of the different stages of physical growth, as in the case of other animals, but      he is endowed with certain other faculties — the reference being to the moral and spiritual side of man’s growth.\n\n      14a. The several stages in the growth of the human child, as given here, and      unknown then, are quite in accordance with scientific investigation. It should be borne in      mind that the word fa, meaning then, as used in then We clothe the bones ... does not      always imply order. This is clear from the context, which states that there is first a lump      of flesh, and the nucleus of the bones is generated in this flesh.\n\n      17a. Instead of the seven heavens, here we have the seven ways, which are no doubt        the orbits of the seven members of the solar system, excluding the earth, as shown by      the words above you.\n\n      20a. In the tree that grows out of Mount Sinai, and which produces oil, there seems      to be reference to the blessed olive tree of 24:35, as representing the Muslim nation; see      24:35a.\n\n      27a. See 11:40a, 40b, 42a.\n\n      33a. The prophets are rejected because they are subject to the same laws of nature in      their human requirements as other men. And no one can be a model for men, who is not      himself a human being, and who is not subject to the same laws of nature as other men,      for only a man can show men how they can avoid falling a prey to the frailties of human      nature. Hence, a Divine incarnation, or God in a human body, cannot serve as a model to      men. We want a mortal to show us how to avoid the pitfalls with which we, as mortals,      are surrounded; if God Himself comes into the world, He cannot serve this purpose.\n\n      41a. It is the occurrence of the word ©ai√ah in this verse which has led many to      think that vv. 33 – 41 of this section refer to H∂d or ˝åli√. But it should be borne in mind      that ©ai√ah means punishment (LL), and is equally applicable to punishment by earthquake or by any other means. In the chronological order of prophets given in the 7th      chapter it is H∂d who follows Noah, and his people ‘Åd were destroyed by a sandstorm.\n\n      44a. The significance of making them stories is that the stories of their evil fate      were the only remembrance of them left when they perished.      50a. There has been much discussion as to the land spoken of in this verse. Rabwah      is lofty ground, and qarår means cultivated land, and a place where water rests in a      meadow (LL). Jerusalem, Egypt, Palestine or Damascus, which are the names suggested,      do not answer the description, which applies exactly to the valley of Kashmir. Part of      the lost ten tribes of Israel is also traced to Kashmir, where a large number of towns and      villages bear the names of the towns and villages of Palestine. The presence of a tomb      known as the tomb of Nabß (i.e., the prophet), or ‘Íså (i.e., Jesus), or Y∂z Åsaf, in the      Khån Yår street in the capital of Kashmir, lends additional support to this theory. The      fact that the chapter deals with the final triumph of prophets and their followers and their      deliverance from the hands of their enemies also gives us a clue to the mystery attending      the circumstances of the disappearance of Jesus Christ after the event of the Cross; for,      as shown in 4:157a, Jesus did not die on the cross. According to a saying of the Holy      Prophet, Jesus lived 120 years (IK, vol. ii, p. 246). This verse tells us that, being delivered from the hands of his enemies, he was given shelter at some other place, and the      description of that place as indicated in this verse, along with the fact that Kashmir has a      tomb, which every available evidence shows to be the tomb of Jesus himself, leads us to      the conclusion that Kashmir is the land referred to in this verse.n\n      As regards the tomb, the following evidence shows that the sacred body of no less a      personage than Jesus Christ rests there: (a) oral testimony, based on tradition, of the      people of Kashmir tells us that the tomb belongs to one who bore the name of Y∂z Åsaf,      who was known as a nabß (i.e., a prophet), and who came to Kashmir from the West      about 2,000 years ago; (b) the Tårßkh A‘˚amß, an historical work written some two hundred years ago, says, referring to this tomb, on p. 82: “The tomb is generally known as      that of a prophet. He was a prince, who came to Kashmir from a foreign land.... His      name was Y∂z Åsaf ”; (c) the Ikmål al-Dßn, an Arabic work, which is a thousand years      old, also mentions Y∂z Åsaf as having travelled in some lands; (d) Joseph Jacobs states,      on the authority of a very old version of the story of Y∂z Åsaf, that he (Joasaph) at last      reached Kashmir, and there died (Barlaam and Josaphat, p. cv).      This evidence shows that the tomb in Khån Yår (Srinagar) is the tomb of Y∂z Åsaf.      But who is this Y∂z Åsaf ? That he is called a nabß (prophet) both in oral tradition and in      history settles the time in which he lived, for no prophet is recognized by the Muslims to      have appeared after their Holy Prophet. Again, there is a striking resemblance between      the names Y∂z and Yas∂‘, the latter being the Hebrew form of Jesus. There is also a      remarkable similarity in the teachings of Y∂z Åsaf and Jesus; for instance, the parable of      the seed-sower occurring in Matt. 13:3, Mark 4:3 and Luke 8:5 occurs also in “Barlaam      and Josaphat” (p. cxi). Another very striking circumstance is that Y∂z Åsaf gave the      name Bushrå (Arabic for Gospel) to his teachings, as the following passage from the      Ikmål al-Dßn shows: “Then he began to compare the tree to the Bushrå, which he      preached to the people”. All these circumstances lead us to the conclusion that Jesus      Christ went to Kashmir after the event of the crucifixion, and that he preached, lived,      died and was buried there.\n\n      76a. The punishment referred to in this verse, and the distress, the removal of which is      mentioned in the previous verse, probably refer to the famine which overtook the Makkans.\n\n      77a. They do not take a warning from the milder punishment, so a severer punishment must follow. This overtook them in the form of battles, leading to their ultimate      vanquishment. But the promise relates to the future as well.\n\n      95a. The promise given to the Holy Prophet in these verses is that the power of his      persecutors will be broken in his lifetime.\n\n      96a. The doing of good in return for evil is the common teaching of all prophets.      But nowhere is the principle put in such a beautiful and practical form as in the Qur’ån.      To return good for evil is only possible under certain circumstances, and the Gospel      doctrine — that ye resist not evil — has not been found practicable. The Qur’ån, however, says, repel evil with that which is best. In repelling evil the rule to be observed is that      it must be repelled by what is best. If you can repel an evil by doing good for it, it is the      course recommended; but if punishment is necessary, that would be the better course. It      is the only workable principle of life.\n\n      97a. The evil suggestions of the devils were really suggestions of the wicked, who      were opposed to the progress of Islåm, and the Prophet is here told to look upon Allåh as      his only support. To seek refuge in the Lord is the height of goodness. Nowhere has a      man a better refuge than in the Source of all strength, and no mortal can aspire to a higher honour than having his refuge in the Lord. The command to the Prophet to say this is      really an image of the aspiration of his soul, the inmost desire which furnished the      guiding rule of his life. His soul rested in that highest degree of security from all evil      suggestions, which is termed refuge in the Lord.\n\n      99a, 99b, see next page.\n\n      95a.

These words make it quite certain that the devils of the two previous verses are      no other than the wicked opponents of the Holy Prophet.\n\n      99b. The original has irji‘∂ni, in which irji‘∂ (“send”) is in the plural, whereas it      should have been irji‘ in the singular in accosting the Divine Being. In Arabic the plural      is sometimes used to denote a repetition of the singular verb, and thus irji‘∂ni is here      regarded as equivalent to a repetition of irji‘nß (Bd). Or, the plural is used out of respect      for the Divine Being.\n\n      100a. That the dead do not return to life is a principle which is reaffirmed here; see also      21:95a. According to the Holy Qur’ån there are three states of a man’s life, viz., his life in      this world, his life in barzakh, and the great manifestation of all spiritual realities that will      take place on the day of Resurrection. Barzakh is the intermediate state in which the soul      lives after death till the Resurrection. Here it is stated that no one who has passed into the      state of barzakh is allowed to go back into the previous state. See further 39:42a.\n\n      102a. Mawåzßn is the plural of mßzån, a balance, and of mauz∂n, meaning, a thing      that is weighed. In both cases the significance is the same, the balance meaning the balance of good deeds.\n\n      110a. Really it was not the believers who caused them to forget the remembrance of      their Lord but, on account of their mocking the believers, the disbelievers forgot their      Lord; hence the believers are here spoken of as though they caused the disbelievers to      forget their Lord.\n\n      115a. This verse establishes the doctrine of the responsibility of human actions.      Man is not created in vain, but he will be returned to his Lord to meet the consequences      of what he does in this life.      "
