      "note": "1a. By this City is meant Makkah (B. 65:90). Thousands of years before, Abraham had prayed for a city to be raised in that wilderness where he had left one branch of his descendants (14:37), and for a Prophet to be raised among them (2:129); see 2:124a.\n\n 2a. The words are parenthetical. Ïill is an infinitive noun, and signifies the same as √alål, meaning in a state which is the opposite of √aråm, and hence it signifies free from obligation or responsibilty with respect to a thing. English translators have generally adopted a different translation: And thou a dweller in this land (Palmer); and thou residest in this territory (Sale); the soil on which thou dost dwell (Rodwell); which is wrong, because √alla, as meaning nazala, i.e., he alighted, or abode, or lodged in a place, has its infinitive √ul∂l or √ull (LL) and not ƒill, which is the word occurring here. Some commentators have also been led into this error. The significance which I adopt is in accordance with the true significance of the word √ill, for you say anta fß √ill-in min kadhå, meaning thou art free from obligation or responsibility with respect to such a thing. The statement in this case is prophetical, indicating that the Prophet would be made free from obligation in respect to the sacredness of the territory of Makkah, being allowed to enter      it by force (Bd), as he did at the conquest of Makkah, to which, in fact, the words refer.There is also a saying of the Holy Prophet in support of this: “And even I was made freefrom obligation with respect to it only for an hour of the day” (B. 64:55).\n\n3a. The great begetter is none other than Abraham, the progenitor of the Arabs, andby he whom he begot is meant either Ishmael, who assisted Abraham in raising the foundations of the Sacred House at Makkah, or the Holy Prophet himself, who was theobject of Abraham’s prayer.\n\n4a. Kabad means distress or difficulty. We are here told that the advancement ofman, even physically, lies along a path of hard struggle. Every conquest that man hasmade has been the result of suffering on his part. The same is the case in the sphere ofthe spiritual advancement of man. Abraham suffered great hardships in the cause ofTruth; and so must the Prophet now, in order to bring about a spiritual awakening in theworld. It is only a long and hard struggle on the part of certain benefactors of humanitythat makes man’s advancement possible, physically as well as spiritually.\n\n5a.  The opponents of Truth, having great power in their hands, never think of themighty power of God. It is to this that attention is drawn here.\n\n6a. The reference is apparently to the ultimate state of the opponents when, afterspending all their wealth for the extermination of Truth, they would find that the causeof Truth was triumphant, and would then say that they really wasted their wealth in awrong cause. Elsewhere we have: “Surely those who disbelieve spend their wealth tohinder (people) from the way of Allåh. So they will go on spending it, then it will be tothem a regret, then they will be overcome” (8:36).\n\n10a. Najd (from najada, he overcame or conquered) means high or elevated land, oralso an elevated or conspicuous road or way (LL). Najdain or the two conspicuous ways arehere spoken of as indicating the ways of truth and falsehood, of truth and falsehood in wordor good and evil in deed (R). The two eyes (v. 8) enable him to distinguish good from evil,while with the tongue and the lips (v. 9) he can ask, if he cannot see for himself.\n\n11a. ‘Aqabah means a mountain road or a road in the upper part of a mountain or along mountain that lies across the way — metaphorically a difficult affair (LL).\n\n16a. Note the tone of these earliest revelations. The service of humanity (along withthe service of God) is the one topic. The doing of good to the oppressed, the poor, andthe orphans is called an uphill road or a high mountain because of the difficulty of doingit. The constant reference to the helping of the poor and the orphans and the setting freeof slaves brings to light the real character of the Prophet, who is described by one knowing him most intimately as one who earned for those who had no means themselves(B. 1:1). No religion has laid so much stress on the uplift of the poor and the distressedas Islåm, and it is the only religion which enjoins the duty of granting freedom to slaves,and the Holy Prophet Mu√ammad is the only founder of a religion who showed thenoble example of freeing all slaves that he ever had and helping in the freedom of others. Yet prejudiced writers blame Islåm for not taking any steps to uproot slavery. Thereis even a suggestion that such precepts regarding the nobility of liberating slaves as existin the Makkan chapters were abrogated by later revelation (see Wherry), a preposterousstatement in view of the plain directions given in 9:60 (the latest revelation) to the Stateitself to spend a part of the public funds in purchasing freedom for slaves."
