      "note": "3a. The verse states the immutable law that every deed is followed by a consequence, and nothing should be looked upon as too small to produce an effect. The two verses that follow are an illustration of this law; good meets with a good reward and evil with an evil punishment. It should be noted that the Qur’ån here speaks of an atom and also of something less than an atom. As less than an atom could only be a part of an atom, evidently the suggestion here is that an atom could be broken into pieces.\n\n 9a. This is the ever-recurring argument of the Holy Qur’ån. The disbelievers deny the last Resurrection, the life after death, the sublime principle of the accountability of human actions, which forms the only basis of high morals, and they are told that, as a proof of the truth of the Resurrection, they will be brought low in this very life for standing in the way of the advancement of Truth. It is compared with the coming of a portion from heaven because they would not be able to avert it.\n\n 10a. Awwaba literally signifies he returned (LL), and applied to a company of men, it journeyed by day (LL), and metonymically åba or awwaba signifies he returned from disobedience to obedience or repeated the praises of God. By the mountains repeating the praises of Allåh, some understand the praising of Allåh in the sense in which all inanimate objects are spoken of in the Holy Qur’ån as glorifying God, while others think that the mountains’ echoing David’s loud praises is meant. But the mention of birds, the attendants of a victorious army (see 16:79a), and iron along with it shows that the reference is to the conquests of David; and the singing of praises by the mountains therefore carries the significance of those residing on mountains yielding to David. Or the jibål (mountains) may here signify mighty men (see 20:105a), who are thus commanded to march along with him to conquer the enemy.\n\n 10b. The making of the iron pliant to him signifies the extensive use of iron by him in his battles, and so do the coats of mail in the next verse.\n\n 11a. The subject of the previous verse is continued. David is enjoined to prepare himself and his army for severe battles, hence the necessity of coats of mail to save life. Some think that the commandment signifies that David should not take anything from the treasury for his own livelihood, and that he should earn his livelihood by an industry, such as the making of coats of mail (Kf). Såbighåt is the plural of såbighah, which is an adjective meaning ample or vast, and is here considered as standing for the noun which it qualifies, for you say dir‘-un såbighat-un meaning an ample coat of mail. But you also say ni‘mat-un såbighat-un, i.e., a complete benefit (LL), and the order given here may imply the doing of perfect deeds. Sard means coats of mail or their rings (LL), and qaddara signifies he made it according to a measure or proportioned it, and also he assigned a particular time for it (LL). Rz favours the latter interpretation, i.e., David is commanded not to employ his whole time in such occupations, for the real object is to do good.\n\n 12a. See 21:81a. The significance is that Solomon’s ships were made to traverse a month’s journey in a day by favourable winds. For Solomon’s navy, see 1 Kings 9:26. But it should be noted that rßƒ (wind) means also power or dominance or conquest (LL), and therefore the meaning may be that Solomon’s kingdom was so large that it was a month’s journey to the East and a month’s journey to the West.\n\n 12b. “Also he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim” (2 Chron. 4:2).\n\n 12c. These jinn were no other than the strangers whom Solomon subjected to his rule and forced into service. See 2 Chron. 2:17-18: “And he set threescore and ten thousand of them to be bearers of burdens, and fourscore thousand to be hewers in the mountain”. Note that the jinn of this verse are the shayåΔßn of 38:37 — “(We subjected to Solomon) the devils, every builder and diver” — where the shayåΔßn or devils are explained by the Qur’ån itself to be no others than the builders and divers whom Solomon had forced into labour. In the first volume, Tabrezß in his commentary on Ïimåsah remarks: “Ab∂ ‘Ulå says the Arabs speak of the jinn frequently, likening a man who is clever in executing affairs to the jinnß and the shaiΔån or devil, and hence they say his jinn is gone, when they mean that he became weak and abased”. This explanation, along with that which the Qur’ån itself affords, settles the question of the jinn and the devils employed by Solomon.\n\n 13a. For the graving of cherubims on the walls, see 2 Chron. 3:7; for the casting of oxen, 2 Chron. 4:3; for the making of lavers, pots, basins, etc., 2 Chron. 4:11, 14. \n\n 14a. The reference in the creature of the earth that ate away his staff is to his son’s weak rule, under whom the kingdom of Solomon went to pieces. It appears that Solomon’s successor, Rehoboam, led a life of luxury and ease, and instead of acting on the advice of the older men, he yielded to the pleasure-seeking wishes of his companions (1 Kings 12:13), and it is to his luxurious habits and easy mode of life that the Holy Qur’ån refers when it calls him a creature of the earth. The eating away of his staff signifies the disruption of the kingdom. The jinn, as already remarked, mean the rebellious tribes who had been reduced to subjection by Solomon, and who remained in subjection to the Israelites for a time, until the kingdom was shattered. This instance, as well as the one following, contains a warning for the Muslims as to the result of falling into luxury and ease, by which, however, they benefited little; the ultimate fate of the respective kingdoms of the Umayyads and Abbasides was the same as that of Solomon’s kingdom. See also 38:34a.\n\n 16a. Saba’ was “a city of Yaman, also called Ma’årab; it was about three days’ journey from ˝an‘å. The bursting of the dyke of Ma’årab and the destruction of the city by a flood are historical facts, and happened in about the first or second century of our era” (Palmer). It is usual to speak of two gardens, for large cultivated areas were bounded by a garden on each side. \n\n 18a. The cities were so close to each other that one could be seen from the other, or they were conspicuous from the road. It is an indication of the great prosperity of the country. The blessed towns are the towns of Syria, with which they carried on trade.\n\n 19a. It is not necessary that they should have thus prayed in words. It is a description of their actual condition, i.e., they were not grateful for the blessings and fell into evil ways, which resulted in punishment overtaking them. Speaking of the trade of Yaman with Syria, Muir says: “The commerce assumed great dimensions and enriched the nation ... and, which is remarkable, the number of stages from Ha˙ramaut to Ayla, given ... as seventy, exactly corresponds with the number at the present day”. The reference in the previous verse to the appointment of the journey might be to these stages.\n\n 22a. It refers to the helplessness of the supposed gods to assist their votaries when distress overtakes them. \n\n 24a. The meaning is that as surely as you are in manifest error, so surely are we on a right way.\n\n 26a. This is a prophecy which was fulfilled in the first decisive battle which clearly decided the issue between the Muslims and their opponents. The question in v. 29 further on — when will this promise be fulfilled? — makes it quite clear.\n\n 28a. The Prophet is repeatedly spoken of as having been sent as a messenger to all people, in the earliest as well as the later revelations. He is called “A warner to the nations (25:1), “A mercy to the nations” (21:107), and so on. In one place, his being sent to men is qualified by the word jamß‘-an (7:158), which means all. Here it is qualified by the word kåffah, which means all without an exception. This word is derived from kaff, which means preventing or withholding, the implication being that it includes all and does not prevent or withhold anyone, or all without an exception. \n\n  30a. The first encounter between the Muslims and their enemies took place in the battle of Badr, after the first year of the Flight had passed away. Elsewhere the same question is answered by the words: “Maybe somewhat of that which you seek to hasten has drawn nigh to you” (27:72). \n\n 31a. They reject not only the Qur’ån but also previous revelation, because it contains prophecies about the appearance of the Holy Prophet. \n\n 36a. This expression is always used to signify that Allåh will give ample means of subsistence to the weaker party and strengthen them against the wealthy transgressors. \n\n 37a. Not only in the highest places in paradise, but also in the highest places in this life — a truth which finds abundant illustration in the lives of the early Muslims. \n\n 39a. Akhlafa is used in the sense of exceeding or surpassing so as to leave another thing behind (from khalf, meaning behind) (LL). Hence yukhlifu-h∂ here signifies that Allåh gives him such a great reward as to leave behind what he had spent in His way. \n\n 41a, see next page.  \n\n 41a. Compare this with the last section, and it will be clear that the very persons mentioned there as the proud ones are spoken of here as the jinn. \n\n 44a. That is, no Book was ever given nor any warner ever raised that taught polytheism; or the meaning may be that, whereas warners appeared all about Arabia, Makkah had not yet seen one. \n\n 45a. That is, in power or in material prosperity the Quraish could not stand comparison with many of the early nations.\n\n 49a. The Truth may stand for Unity and falsehood for polytheism, the significance being that idol-worship will never again find access to Makkah. Compare 17:81: “Say: The Truth has come and falsehood vanished. Surely falsehood is ever bound to vanish”. 51a. In this world, they were seized upon at Badr and again at Makkah. \n\n 52a. For death shall then have removed them into the other world.\n\n 53a. Their conjectures that the Prophet will not be successful have no value, as they have no access to the unseen. \n\n 54a. Indeed, no punishment is greater than failure to attain that which a man desires most eagerly. This is the hell of this life \n\n"
