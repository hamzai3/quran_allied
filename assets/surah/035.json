      "note": " 1a. God is here mentioned by his name FåΔir, from faΔara, which means he clove or split, also he originated or brought a thing into existence newly or for the first time, it not having existed before (LL). There may be reference to the creation of primeval matter in the original significance of cleaving or splitting. Derived from the same root is fiΔrah, which means nature or constitution or natural or original quality in which all men are said to have been made — the nature made by Allåh in which He has created men (30:30) — and which has therefore been translated as the faculty of knowing God with which He has created mankind (LL). So there may be reference to this fiΔrah in the use of the word FåΔir, the fiΔrah or nature of man having a close relation with the FåΔir or the Maker of that fiΔrah. \n\n The representation of angels as possessing wings is met with in sacred history, but the janå√ or wing of an angel by no means indicates the fore-limbs of a bird, which fit it for flight. It is a symbol of power enabling these immaterial beings to execute their functions, and in Arabic, the word janå√ stands for power, as you say huwa maq©∂© al-janå√ (lit., he has the wing clipped), meaning he is one who lacks strength or power or ability, or he is impotent (T, LL). Angels are here spoken of as having two, three or four wings. Is there a reference here to the rak‘ahs of prayer which are two, three or four in number? The morning prayer consists of two rak‘ahs, the maghrib of three and the two afternoon prayers, and the ‘Ishå’ of four rak‘ahs. In prayer man holds communion with God and is raised to spiritual eminence; he, as it were, flies to God, is on his wings, and the angels are the agents which make him fly to God, their wings thus standing for the rak‘ahs of prayer.\n\n 1b. The increase in creation may refer in a general sense to the new creation which is going on momentarily in this universe, or there may be a reference here to the increase in the number of the elect which was to be brought about through the Prophet. Or still again, the meaning may be that the power of angels is not limited to two, three or four wings, for there are angels of mighty power like Gabriel, who is spoken of as having six hundred wings. \n\n 9a. The quickening here is clearly the quickening to spiritual life. \n\n 10a. The ultimate triumph of truth and the destruction of falsehood could not be expressed in clearer words. Good words ascend to God, i.e., prosper and bear fruit, and good deeds are exalted, while the evil plans to destroy Truth perish. \n\n 11a. There is a hint that the seed of truth is sown and generates in a similar manner. \n\n 13a. The Arabic word qiΔmßr stands for the white point in the back of a date-stone. \n\n 22a. Note how spiritual truths are conveyed in words relating to physical life. Those in the graves are the very men who were actively engaged in opposition to the Prophet. The seeing are those who have their eyes opened spiritually, the light is the spiritual light, the living are those alive in spirit, and so on. \n\n 24a. This broad doctrine that a prophet was raised among every nation is taught repeatedly in the Qur’ån, and, curiously enough, it is met with in the earlier revelation at Makkah as well as the later revelation at Madßnah. This great truth, which had remained hidden for thousands of years from the wisest men of the world, had shone upon the mind of an unlearned Arabian, who did not even know what nations then existed and what scriptures they possessed. This broad doctrine alone could form the basis of the universality of a Divine message to the whole of mankind. Only he who had the breadth of mind to recognize truth in all could unite all men. \n\n 25a. See 3:184a.  \n\n 29a. Tijårah literally signifies a buying and selling for gain, hence I render the word here as meaning gain. \n\n 31a. Note that as the Holy Qur’ån recognizes that prophets were raised in every nation, so it claims that previous revelation contains prophecies which have been fulfilled in the advent of the Holy Prophet. This is an early Makkan revelation. \n\n 32a. After speaking of the revelation of the Qur’ån to the Prophet, we are told that the Holy Book was now being given as an inheritance to a chosen people, i.e., the Muslim community, who are chosen to carry this great message to the whole world. But the chosen people are not all alike. Among the elect are some people who wrong themselves — they do not fulfil Divine commandments. There are others among them who follow a middle course; they are not wrongdoers but they are not very active in the doing of good. There are others still, who are foremost in the doing of good, who are elsewhere called muqarrab∂n (56:11), those who have attained to nearness to God. It is thus made clear that when a community is spoken of as being a chosen community, all members of it are not alike. It is chosen because of those who are foremost in the doing of good, whose example the others should try to follow. \n\n 33a. The promise refers to this life as well as to the next. See 22:23a, where it is shown that the Caliph ‘Umar made Suråqah wear Kisrå’s bracelets of gold. \n\n 34a. Here is drawn a true picture of paradise: Who has removed grief from us. This shows that freedom from grief and anxiety is the real bliss of paradise. The repeated promise to the righteous, that they shall have no fear nor shall they grieve, expresses the same truth, and shows that paradise begins in this life. \n\n 35a. Note this further description of a spiritual paradise: where toil and fatigue no more afflict a man. It is all peace and satisfaction and the highest bliss of Arabia. The Arabs, therefore, said that, if a prophet came to them as prophets came to other people, they would follow him, and set an example of goodness. \n\n 45a. Similar words occur in 16:61: “And if Allåh were to destroy men for their iniquity, He would not leave therein a single creature”. Evidently by dåbbah or creature here are meant people bent low on earth, people ignorant of the higher or spiritual values of life, or the iniquitous; see 27:82a and 34:14a. \n\n"
