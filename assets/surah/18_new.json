    {
      "note": "1a. In connection with this chapter, the Holy Prophet is reported to have said: He  who remembers the first ten verses of the chapter entitled the “Cave” is protected from  the tribulation of Dajjål (Antichrist) (Ms. 6:42). Shi‘bah mentions the last ten verses of  The Cave instead of the first ten (AD. 36:12).  Now in the first and the last sections of this chapter the Christian doctrine of the  divinity of Jesus is condemned. In the first section a warning is given to those who say  Allåh has taken to Himself a son (v. 4), in the last two to those who take My servants to  be friends besides Me (v. 102), and this doctrine, the doctrine of sonship and of the  divinity of a servant of God, is the basic doctrine of the Christian religion. Moreover, in  the concluding ten verses, a true description of the occupation of Christian nations is  given in the words whose effort goes astray in this world’s life (v. 104). The Holy  Qur’ån does not speak of the appearance of Dajjål, or Antichrist, anywhere but the  Prophet’s saying quoted above plainly shows that the Dajjål of the Ïadßth is the same as  the upholders of the erroneous Christian doctrine of the sonship and divinity of Jesus  Christ. Christianity, in its present form, being opposed to the true teachings of Christ, is  thus the only Antichrist known to the Qur’ån. It may be added that Dajjål signifies one  who conceals the truth with falsehood, or a liar or a great deceiver (LL).  /n/n 2a. The Qur’ån is here described as possessing two qualifications. The first refers to  its own perfection, there is no crookedness in it; and the second speaks of it as a book  suited to make others perfect, for it is called qayyim, as meaning one that rightly directs  others. Or, it is called qayyim, meaning maintainer, as regulating the affairs of men or as  maintaining the spiritual truth, which indeed would have been entirely lost to the world  but for its being guarded by the Holy Qur’ån.  /n/n 6a. This verse gives us an insight into the anxiety which the Holy Prophet had on  account of a fallen humanity, an anxiety so great that he is spoken of here as almost  killing himself with grief. His was a life of absolute devotion to the cause of humanity, his  only concern being that man should rise to the true dignity for which God had made him.  This anxiety was not only for those who were directly addressed by him, but, as the context shows, it was as deep for another people, who attributed a son to the Divine Being,  and whom outward finery was to mislead to such an extent as to make them strangers to  spiritual truth. Reading the next verse along with this, no doubt is left that the Prophet  was shown the earthly embellishments which are so great a trial for Christendom today.  The word ƒadßth means new or recent, and hence is applied to a narration or  announcement which is new or which gives some new information. It here refers to the  Qur’ån.  /n/n 8a. Vv. 7 and 8 direct man’s attention to the fact that the finery of this life does not  last forever. A dweller in the desert of Arabia, with no sight before his eyes but that of  the sands of the desert and bare, rugged hills, could not imagine the earth being embellished. The picture drawn here is evidently of the beautiful cities of the modern age, with  all their attractions and luxuries, which so engross men that they neither pay attention to  the preaching of truth nor to the pursuit of righteousness. Yet where there is growth  there is decay, and those who indulge in luxuries do not escape ruin; it is their ruin that  is indicated in the words dust, without herbage. We have already seen how clearly the  Qur’ån states that a severe punishment would overtake the world and destroy populous  towns: There is not a town but We will destroy it before the day of Resurrection or chastise it with a severe chastisement (17:58); see 17:58a. The earth will be first beautified  to its utmost, we are told here, and then laid waste, by man’s own hands, lofty buildings  being reduced to dust and beautiful gardens being turned into bare earth without any  herbage on it. All prophecies made known through the righteous servants of God, the  prophets of the Old Testament and Jesus Christ, and then through the Qur’ån and the  Ïadßth, point to world-wide conflicts in the latter days, of nation rising against nation, of  great calamities, of destruction of cities on a vast scale. All these things this generation  has seen with its own eyes. Science first embellished the earth and science is now  turning it into a waste, by its atom bombs and other diabolic inventions. The powerful  hand of God is thus seen clearly working in the history of the world. /n/n 9a. Kahf signifies a cave as well as a place of refuge, and raqßm means an inscription or a tablet with a writing upon it. Now The Cave, as I have already stated, stands for that peculiar aspect of the Christian religion which finds manifestation in its institution of monkery, this being the distinctive characteristic which it assumed soon after its  birth. But what about the Inscription? This word contains a prophetical reference to  another aspect of the Christian religion, quite opposed to its first aspect of growth in the  Cave. Inscription (or Advertisement) is, in fact, as prominent a feature of the business  activities of the Christian nations of today as the Cave was a feature of their religious  activities in the early days. The Holy Qur’ån seems to have chosen the epithets to  designate the Christian nations by thus indicating their most prominent characteristics in  their early and their latter days. The first and the last conditions of Christianity thus  seem to be hinted at in the Cave and the Inscription respectively, a religion of monkery  turned into a religion of business. As for the story of the dwellers in the Cave, see 13a. /n/n 11a. The words ˙arabnå ‘alå ådhån-i-him are explained as mana‘nå hum al-sam‘a,  i.e., we prevented them from hearing. This is Dk’s explanation, and it is nearest the original sense of the words, for one significance of ˙araba is ©adda, i.e., he prevented (T,  LL). The preventing from hearing is then understood to be equivalent to causing to  sleep, but the original meaning is favoured by the context, the significance being that  these people remained cut off from the rest of the world for a number of years. Thus the  Holy Qur’ån neither supports the story of these men remaining in the cave for hundreds  of years, nor of their being actually in a condition of continuous sleep all this while. /n/n 12a. The raising them up might signify raising them up from sleep, as also raising  them up into a condition of activity, after their remaining cut off from the world, as  stated in the previous verse. What it means with reference to the story itself, or with  reference to the history of Christianity, is explained in the second and the third sections. /n/n 13a. The memorable story of the “seven sleepers”, with whom the companions of the  Cave and the Inscription are identified, is a story of the reign of the Emperor Decius. Seven  noble youths of Ephesus, it is said, took refuge in a cave to escape Decius’ persecution. But  the Emperor, eventually learning this, ordered the entrance to the cave to be firmly secured  with a pile of large stones. It is stated that the youths fell asleep as soon as they were shut up /n/n in the cave, and awoke 187 years after this in the reign of Theodosius, when the stones were  removed by the slaves of one Adollius to supply building material for some edifice. They  then sent one of their number, Jamblicus, to bring food for them from the city, but he was  taken to the judge on presenting a coin of the reign of Decius, and thus the youths were discovered. It is related that the Emperor himself saw their radiant faces. This is the account  given by Gibbon. But some state that these youths remained in that condition for 375 years.  That there may be a modicum of truth underlying this story is not only most  probable, but almost certain, for the story could not otherwise have found such wide  prevalence. The story as narrated in the Qur’ån does not credit the unnatural incidents of  the above account. It only speaks of some men having taken refuge in a dark cave on  account of a religious persecution; where and when it does not state. That is all that is  stated in this section of the story, and apparently it seems to be continued in the third,  while, according to another view, the third section may be a prophetic description of the  later growth of Christianity itself. Taking, however, the first view, what is related in the  third section is that, after they had rested for a part of a day, they made arrangements to  get their food from outside, and remained in this condition for “a number of years”  (v. 11), but were subsequently discovered, and an edifice being built at the mouth of the  cave caused their death. It mentions conjectures as to their number and the number of  years they remained in the cave, but does not go beyond saying that there were some  men who remained in the cave for some years.  There is another very plausible suggestion that the persons referred to here were  Joseph of Arimathaea and some other early Christians, their place of refuge being  Glastonbury in England, which on account of its northern position well answers the  description of the Cave as given in the Qur’ån. According to William of Malmesbury,  Joseph of Arimathaea “was sent to Britain by St. Philip, and having received a small  island in Somersetshire, there constructed with twisted twigs the first Christian church in  Britain, afterwards to become the abbey of Glastonbury. The legend says that his staff  planted in the ground became a thorn, flowering twice a year” (En. Br., Art. “Joseph of  Arimathaea”). In the tenth edition of En. Br. Joseph of Arimathaea is said to have “wandered into Britain in the year 63”. “The Glastonbury thorn, which is said to be a distinct  variety, was regularly visited by pilgrims until it was destroyed about the Reformation  times.” Again we find in the En. Br. under Glastonbury: “According to the legends which  grew up under the care of the monks, the first church of Glastonbury was a little wattled  building erected by Joseph of Arimathaea as the leader of the twelve apostles sent over to  Britain from Gaul by St. Philip”. The legends of the “Holy Grail” again connect the name  of Joseph of Arimathaea with Britain. According to one of these the Grail, which was the  dish of the last supper, was confined to the care of Joseph, while according to another,  “the Grail is said to have followed Joseph to Britain” (En. Br., Art. “Grail”). All these  may be legends, but they are certainly not without an undercurrent of truth. The connection of the name of Joseph of Arimathaea with Britain is the strong central fact underlying them all. What makes it still more significant is the fact that Joseph of Arimathaea,  who appears very prominently in the closing scenes of the Gospels, so much so that one  Gospel looks upon him as a disciple of Jesus, altogether disappears from the history of  Christianity as imaged in the propagandic efforts of the apostles. Does this not show that  he had changed the scene of his exertions? May then Joseph of Arimathaea and his companions be taken as being referred to in the story of the Companions of the Cave and the  Inscription? If an answer could be found in the affirmative, then England could definitely  be said to be the Cave referred to in the Holy Qur’ån, and the description of the Cave  given in v. 17 well applies to it; see 17a. But even if our answer to that question is in the  negative, the story itself is not without a deeper meaning, and more statements than one  show that there is a reference to the history of Christianity itself in the story.  /n/n 14a. This is to show that the early followers of Christianity were Unitarians. /n/n 17a. The verse does not speak of any miraculous change in the sun’s course; it does  not speak of any change at all. It simply describes the position of the cave, which was so  situated that it did not admit sunshine. This could easily happen in a cave with its mouth  to the north, situated in the northern hemisphere and above the tropic of cancer. In fact,  the description applies to any country in the northern hemisphere north of the tropic of  cancer. The whole of Europe thus, in one sense, answers the description of the cave. It is  a fact that Christianity spread first in Europe.  /n/n 18a. What is related in this section is clearly applicable to the story of the seven  sleepers, as also to the later history of Christianity. Taking the first view, the meaning is  that the youths, who fled for fear of persecution and betook themselves to a cave, slept  for some time with a dog at the door of the cave. The whole scene was rather aweinspiring; a dark cave, in some distant and uninhabited part of the country, with some  men sleeping in it and a dog at the door, would have inspired awe into the heart of a  casual looker-on. Applied to the history of Christianity the statement is equally true. In  this case it should be borne in mind that ruq∂d (“asleep”) also means inactive, or  stagnant. Thus raqada means qa‘ada, ta’akhkhara, i.e., he abstained or held back from  the affair (T, LL). Raqadati-l-s∂qu is equivalent to kasadat, i.e., the market became  stagnant or dull with respect to traffic (LL), and ruq∂d is the infinitive noun of raqada.  Similarly aiqå˚ (“awake”) is plural of yaqi˚, which means a man vigilant, wary, in a  state of caution, or a man having his attention much roused (LL). Tayaqqa˚a-li l-amr  means tanabbaha, i.e., he had his attention roused to the affair (T). The turning about to  the right and to the left, which signifies an uneasy condition while sleeping, may be used  as expressing the activities of a man or a nation. Thus there may be a reference here  to the lethargy in which the Christian nations remained for a long time, and to their  subsequent going about in the world to the right and to the left, i.e., spreading in all  directions. It may also be noted that Europeans are generally fond of dogs. /n/n 19a. The question and the answer may refer either to the time for which the youths  slept or to the centuries of inactivity or tardiness of the Christian nations. A day of a thousand years is spoken of in the Holy Qur’ån on more occasions than one (see 22:47, etc.),  and therefore the word day, applied to the history of a nation, may signify a thousand years. /n/n 19b. After having been refreshed with sleep, which might have been brought on by  the fatigue of the journey, they thought of procuring food for themselves in that solitary  cave and sent one of them to the city, and impressed on him that he should be gentle and  should not give an inkling of their whereabouts to anyone. In reference to the history of  Christianity, the passage may be said to speak of the commercial activities of the  Christian nations.  /n/n21a. That is, they would have remained hidden had it not been for the necessities of  life, which they had still to procure from the city. It was their going out to purchase food  that brought them to the knowledge of the outside world. It is not stated how long they  continued in this state: they may have passed some days or months or years, but their  daily going out at last made their hiding-place known to others. Comparing this with  v. 11, however, we may say that they passed several years in this condition. /n/n 21b. The result of their becoming known is described in words which show that they  were put to death, because the promise of Allåh as to a future state of life is fully realized only after death.  /n/n 21c. These words show how their death was brought about: it was by closing the  mouth of the cave. This is what is meant by the erection of an edifice over them. The  words may also signify the erection of a monument.  /n/n 21d. The masjid, or the mosque, is the house of worship of the Muslims in particular, but it may mean any house of worship. The people spoken of here are those who  prevailed in their affair. This is a later incident, when Christianity became the dominant  religion of the Roman Empire, and the reference here seems to be to the saint-worship  which prevailed in Christianity. /n/n 22a. This verse and v. 25, coming as they do after the story is finished, show that  these are only conjectures of the people with regard to them. Their number and the number of years during which they remained in the cave are both matters which are said to  be only known to Allåh. I‘Ab is, however, of opinion that the words condemning the  first two as conjectures show that the last-mentioned number, i.e., seven, is correct.  Who are the people referred to in the concluding words, any of them? According to  IJ, the people of the Book, or the Christians, are referred to here, though they are not  expressly mentioned in what has gone before. It is clear from this that it is really the history of Christianity that is dealt with in the story of the Companions of the Cave. V. 25,  which again speaks of the same people who are spoken of here, makes it clear that it is  the history of Christianity that is really aimed at.  /n/n 23a. Though the words are general, there seems to be a special prophetic reference  to the Prophet’s Flight and his taking refuge in a cave. He had entirely to trust in Allåh,  Who was to bring it about as He thought best for him.  /n/n 24a. The meaning is that the difficulties which had to be experienced by the  dwellers in the cave would be removed from the Prophet’s way. He had to pass only  three days in the cave, and though a powerful enemy exerted itself to its utmost, his hiding-place at only a distance of three miles from the city, whither food was conveyed to  him, could not be discovered. Or, in the nearer course there is a reference to the  unprecedented triumph of Islåm, which spread over the whole of Arabia within twentythree years, and spread from Spain in the west to China in the east within a century,  whereas Christianity remained in a state of subjection in its birth-place for three hundred  years, as stated in the verse that follows. /n/n 25a. Commentators consider this verse as being conjoined to v. 22 with the words  they say as being understood. But as shown in 22a, the history of Christianity, which  runs like an undercurrent in the story of the Companions of the Cave, finds a clear  expression now. There is no tradition that the Companions of the Cave remained in the  Cave for three hundred years, but Christianity itself remained in a Cave for full three  hundred years. It is a fact that Christianity rose to power with the conversion of  Constantine, and at the same time it lost its purity with the formulation of the doctrine of the Trinity, which was promulgated in 325 A.D. It is, moreover, now almost agreed that  Jesus Christ was born five or six years before the reputed date of his birth. Bishop  Barnes says in The Rise of Christianity that he may have been born in 6–5 B.C. So if he  began his ministry at the age of thirty, the Christian religion may be said to have been  born at about 25 A.D., and thus exactly after three hundred years it lost its purity by the  promulgation of the Trinitarian doctrine, emerging at the same time as a State religion.  Thus it remained in the Cave for three hundred years.  But what does this, the addition of nine years, mean? To reduce solar years to lunar  years, three years have to be added to every hundred years, and to the three centuries  another nine years are thus added. It is due to this computation that nine years are  spoken of as being added.  /n/n 26a. Ab©ir bi-hß wa asmi‘ means må ab©ara wa asma‘a, or what a sight He has and  what a hearing! The reference here is to the prophecies of the ultimate triumph of the  Prophet and Islåm.  /n/n 27a. By kalimåt (“words”) are meant here prophecies, because it is the prophecy of  the Prophet’s Flight and his final triumph over his enemies that is referred to here. These  prophecies, it is claimed, cannot be altered by men, and they must come to pass,  how ever great the opposing forces. /n/n 29a. They refused the water of spiritual life in this life, and so they will have no  water to quench their thirst in the life after death.  /n/n 31a. It is after these things that men hanker in this life, but the ornaments and robes  of this life are transitory. The righteous, who in this life desire and struggle for only spiritual ornaments and moral beauty, find these visible in the after-life. It should, however,  be borne in mind that these prophecies were in one sense brought to fulfilment in this  very life. The Arabs, whose only wealth consisted of their camels and horses, and whose  clothes were made of skins or cloth of rough textures, found the treasures of Rome and  Persia laid at their feet, and the bracelets of gold and the silk brocade interwoven with  gold, which they had never seen before, were now brought to them in abundance, while  the gardens of Mesopotamia and Persia were given to them for a permanent heritage. /n/n 32a. The parable — it is clearly called a parable and is not at all a story — set forth  here is undoubtedly a parable to illustrate the condition of the Christian and the Muslim  nations. The former received an abundance of the wealth of this life, as is indicated by  the gardens of the parable, while the latter, though poorer in worldly possessions, were  richer in the heavenly blessings of Allåh. The former reject the message of Truth, of which the latter are the bearers, and their vaunt is the same as that of the wealthy man in  the parable: I have greater wealth than thou, and am mightier in followers (v. 34).  /n/n 36a. By the “Hour” is meant the hour of doom which must overtake every people  who reject the Truth. /n/n 42a. Here we have an exact description of the havoc that is being wrought in the  world before our eyes.  /n/n 52a. Bain has three significances, viz., disunion, union, and between (LL), and  maubiq means perdition or separation, or fatal enmity (T).  /n/n 57a. It is when man becomes so iniquitous as to turn away from the truth and so callous as not to care for the evil that he does that a veil is placed over his heart.  /n/n 58a. According to Kf, the appointed time referred to is the battle of Badr. But Truth  is one and the same for all ages, and we see signs of the doom of the latter-day opposition to Islåm clearly approaching.  /n/n 59a. The personal pronoun their refers to the opponents of Truth, earlier as well as  later /n/n 60a. Some reports give his name as Joshua, the son of N∂n, the man who afterwards  appears so prominently in the history of Israel. The incidents narrated in the ninth and the tenth sections may be the actual experience of Moses or this journey may simply be an Ascension of Moses, like the Ascension  of the Holy Prophet, referred to in the last chapter. What is stated in the next section  makes the latter view more probable.  /n/n 60b. The words Majma‘ al-Baƒrain have been misunderstood generally. It should  be borne in mind that Moses lived in Egypt for forty years, and the junction of the two  rivers is no other than the junction of the two great branches of the Nile at Khartoum.  That the story of this journey of Moses is not found in the Bible or even in Rabbinical  literature is no argument against it. Rabbinical literature relates things about Moses  which give us strong reason to believe that such a journey was very probably undertaken  by him. South of Egypt was the Kingdom of Ethiopia, whose southern boundary reached  Khartoum, or the junction of the two Niles, and various accounts met with both in /n/n 60c Rabbinical and Hellenistic literature (see Jewish Encyclopaedia) agree that Moses went  to Ethiopia. According to one of these accounts, he became king of Ethiopia by reason  of his great prowess in having defeated an enemy, and married the king’s widow. This is  corroborated to some extent by the statement in the Bible that “Miriam and Aaron spoke  against Moses because of the Ethiopian woman whom he had married” (Num. 12:1).  Hence a journey to Khartoum, which was near the southern boundary of Ethiopia, made  in search of knowledge, is most probable. The person to whom Moses went was Kha˙ir  (B. 3:44). Some commentators, however, do not take the words Majma‘ al-Baƒrain literally, taking the meaning to be the union of the rivers of human and Divine knowledge.  I would, however, suggest that if we accept this journey in the light of an Ascension, it  would be an indication of the limitation of the Mosaic dispensation. Moses’ going on for  years until he reached the Majma‘ al-Baƒrain would mean that the Mosaic dispensation  would see its termination after a time, the new dispensation taking its place being one  which was to be guided by a prophet who is described here as being the Majma‘ alBaƒrain, i.e., the union of the two seas of human and Divine knowledge, or one in  whom the temporal and the spiritual would find their highest manifestation, such being  the Holy Prophet Muƒammad.  /n/n 60c. Ïuqub signifies a long time, or a year or seventy years or eighty years (LL).  /n/n 61a. The loss of the fish was, according to a report, to serve as a sign that the goal  had been attained (B. 3:44). There is nothing either in the Holy Qur’ån or in the Ïadßth  to show, however, that this was a roasted fish. /n/n 63a. The taking refuge on the rock shows that they were staying at a place which  was flooded by the river, and Moses’ companion, when hastening for refuge, forgot to  take the fish along with him. The wonder is not expressed at the fish having gone down  into the river, but because he had forgotten to mention the loss to Moses.  /n/n 78a. The interpretation of the three incidents shows a manifestation of Divine wisdom in what takes place in the everyday life of man. Divine laws, as manifested in  nature, are really working towards ultimate good, though sometimes they may appear to  the outward eye to be working to the detriment of somebody. The beneficent hand of  Allåh that works in nature is always directing humanity to the goal of great good, though  that goal must necessarily be reached with apparent loss. Sometimes the loss is only  apparent, as in the case of making a hole in the boat; there was no real loss, but the  apparent loss served a great purpose and brought much benefit to the owner. The second  instance is that in which there is real loss to a person, but it is for the good of humanity  at large, for life must be sacrificed for the ultimate good of humanity. The third instance  shows that, for the good of humanity, deeds must be done which bring no immediate  reward, and that good done by one generation is not devoid of benefit to the next.  Moses himself had, in fact, to undergo the experience of his teacher, and the  incidents seem no more than prophetic allegories of Moses’ own life-work. Just as the  scuttling of a boat causes apprehension to the safety of its occupants, Moses had to lead  his people to a place where they thought they had only been brought to be drowned; but  their safe passage through the sea showed that it was for their good. Then he had to  order his men to fight against an iniquitous people and to put them to death, but he was  not shedding human blood to no purpose, for it was really a step towards the evolution  of a better race. And finally, his devoting his own life to the Israelites, descendants of a righteous man, corresponded to his teacher’s building the wall for the orphans without  claiming recompense. Read in this light, the narration is clearly an Ascension of Moses,  foreshadowing the great events which were to befall him. /n/n 80a. That the youth himself deserved death is abundantly clear. His inordinacy had  now reached an extreme — the circumstances seem to have been known to Kha˙ir,  though not to Moses — when it was feared that his innocent parents would be involved  in the trouble which must befall him as a result of his wrongdoing. Note that the word  used to indicate the youth’s wrongdoing is Δughyån, which means exceeding all limits in  wrongdoing.  /n/n 83a. The word qarn means a horn, as also a generation or a century, and Dhu-lqarnain therefore literally means the two-horned one, or one belonging to two generations or two centuries. The reference here seems to be to the two-horned ram of Daniel’s  vision (Dan. 8:3), which he interpreted as the Kingdoms of Media and Persia, which  were combined into a single kingdom under one ruler, Cyrus, who is erroneously called  Darius in the Bible (En. Bib. and Jewish En., Art. “Darius”). The reference in Daniel’s  vision is, however, not to Cyrus but to Darius I Hystaspes (521-485 B.C.), “who allowed  the Jews to rebuild their temple, and is referred to in Ezra 4:5, 24; 5:5; 6:1; Hag. 1:1;  2:10; Zech. 1:7, and probably in Neh. 12:22. His liberality towards the Jews is in complete accord with what we know otherwise of his general policy in religious matters  towards the subject nations” (En. Bib. “Darius”).  That “the two-horned ram” of Daniel’s vision is the king of Media and Persia is  made plain in Daniel’s book, where the interpretation of the dream is given in the  following words: “The ram which thou sawest having two horns are the Kings of Media  and Persia” (Dan. 8:20). The reference in the Qur’ån in the history of Dhu-l-qarnain is  to Darius I: “Darius was the organizer of the Persian Empire. His conquests served to  round off the boundaries of his realm in Armenia, the Caucasus, and India, and along the  Turanian steppes and the highlands of Central Asia” (Jewish En., “Darius I”). The  following remarks in the En. Br. strengthen this view: “Darius in his inscriptions  appears as a fervent believer in the true religion of Zoroaster. But he was also a great  statesman and organizer. The time of conquests had come to an end; the wars which  Darius undertook, like those of Augustus, only served the purpose of gaining strong natural frontiers for the empire and keeping down the barbarous tribes on its borders. Thus  Darius subjugated the wild nations of the Pontic and Armenian mountains, and extended  the Persian dominion to the Caucasus; for the same reason he fought against the Sacae  and other Turanian tribes”. The references in this quotation to Darius being a fervent  believer in the true religion of Zoroaster, to his subduing the barbarous tribes on the  borders, to his gaining strong natural frontiers for the empire, and to his fighting against  the Sacae clearly point him out as the Dhu-l-qarnain of the Qur’ån. /n/n 86a. Maghrib al-shams, or the setting-place of the sun, signifies the western-most  point of his empire, because going towards the west he could not go beyond it. /n/n  86b. The words in Arabic are ‘ain-in ƒami’at-in, which literally mean a black sea,  ‘ain meaning an abundance of water, or a place in which water remains and collects,  and ƒami’at means black mud (T, LL). The place referred to is no other than the Black  Sea, as, Armenia being within the Kingdom of Persia, the Black Sea formed the  northwestern boundary of the empire. /n/n 88a. Being a true follower of Zoroaster, the well-known Persian prophet, Darius  seems to have invited these tribes to his religion. /n/n 90a. The three journeys alluded to seem to have been undertaken with the object of  strengthening the frontiers of the empire, the most important of these being that spoken  of in v. 93, the part of the frontier between the Caspian and the Black Seas, where the  Caucasus afforded a natural protection against the attacks of the Scythians. Darius goes  first westward to the Black Sea (vv. 85, 86). Then he undertakes an eastward journey —  the land of the rising sun. The description of the people found here, a people who had no  shelter from the sun, is a description of the barbarous aboriginal tribes on the shores of  the Caspian. The En. Br. says in the article on Media: “The names in the Assyrian  inscriptions prove that the tribes in the Zagros and the northern parts of Media were not  Iranians nor Indo-Europeans, but an aboriginal population, like the early inhabitants of  Armenia, perhaps connected with the numerous tribes of the Caucasus. We can see how  the Iranian element gradually became dominant: princes with Iranian names occasion -  ally occur as the rulers of these tribes. But the Galae, Tapuri, Cadusii, Amardi, Utii, and  other tribes in Northern Media and on the shores of the Caspian, were not Iranians”.  /n/n 93a. The two mountains are the mountains of Armenia and Azarbaijan. The people  settling there spoke a different language and could not understand the Iranian language.  /n/n 94a. This verse brings us face to face with an all-important subject, viz., the identity  of Gog and Magog. The Bible references to Gog and Magog are somewhat loose. In  Gen. 10:2 and 1 Chron. 1:5, “Magog is mentioned as the second son of Japheth,between Gomer and Madai, Gomer representing the Cimmerians and Madai the Medes.  Magog must be a people located east of the Cimmerians and west of the Medes. But in  the list of nations, Gen. 10, the term connotes rather the complex of barbarian peoples  dwelling at the extreme north and north-east of the geographical survey covered by that  chapter. ... In Ezek. 38:2 Magog occurs as the name of a country; in Ezek. 39:6 as that  of a northern people, the leader of whom is Gog” (Jewish En., Art. “Gog and Magog”).  “Josephus identifies them with the Scythians, a name which among the classical writers  stands for a number of unknown ferocious tribes. According to Jerome, Magog was  situated beyond the Caucasus near the Caspian Sea” (Jewish En.). The En. Br. considers  the traditional identification of Gog and Magog with the Scythians to be “plausible”, and  then adds: “This plausible opinion has been generally followed”, with this reservation,  that the word may be applied to “any or all of the numerous but partially known tribes of  the north; and any attempt to assign a more definite locality to Magog can only be very  hesitatingly made”.  All these writers have, however, not paid sufficient attention to the words of Ezek.  38:2: “Gog, the land of Magog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal”. Tubal and  Meshech are almost always mentioned together, and their identification has been a task  of great difficulty, so much so that a renowned Biblical critic suggests the names of certain nations in South Palestine. But this contradicts the views of ancient writers like  Josephus, who settle the Magog north of the Caucasus. If we go, however, to the north  of the Caucasus, we find still two rivers bearing the names of Tobal and Moskoa, on the  latter of which is situated the ancient city of Moscow, and on the former the more recent  town of Tobolsk. It seems almost certain that these two rivers received their names from  the two tribes of Ezek. 38:2, the Tubal and Meshech, and then gave their names to the  two above-mentioned cities, thus keeping the names of these tribes. This view is in  accordance with the opinion of Josephus, who identifies Magog with the Scythians, for  “throughout classical literature Scythia generally meant all regions to the north and  north-east of the Black Sea, and a Scythian any barbarian coming from these parts”.  It is clear from the above that the name Magog stands for tribes which occupied  territories to the north and north-east of the Black Sea, tribes which gave their names  directly or indirectly to the towns of Tobolsk and Moscow.  There is, however, another point worth considering, and that is the gigantic effigies  of Gog and Magog in Guildhall, London. “It is known,” says the En. Br., “that effigies  similar to the present existed in London as early as the time of Henry V”. An explanation of this remarkable circumstance is given by Geoffrey of Monmouth: “Gaemot or  Gaemagot (probably a corrupted form of Gog and Magog) was a giant who, along with  his brother Gorineous, tyrannized in the western horn of England until slain by foreign  invaders” (En. Br., Art. “Gog and Magog”). It is very difficult to speak with anything  bordering on accuracy about the early connections of different races, but the preservation of the effigies of Gog and Magog in England, which can be traced to a very early  period in English history, makes it probable that the Angles or the Saxons had in very  ancient times some connection with the Scythians or other tribes living north of the  Caucasus or the Black Sea. The relations of the different nations in early history are very  complicated, and it is out of place to enter into any such discussion here. But it may be  noted that the Goths, who are considered to be the easternmost of the Teutonic races, are  said to have migrated into Scythia (En. Br., “Goths”), which shows the existence of connection between the two races. And again, “the Batharnae also, who in the third century  B.C. invaded and settled in the regions between the Carpathians and the Black Sea, are said by several ancient writers to have been Teutonic by origin, though they had largely  intermarried with the native inhabitants” (En. Br., “Teutonic Peoples”).  It is thus clear that the ancestors of the present Teutonic and Slav races are the Gog  and Magog spoken of in the Holy Qur’ån. The effigies of Gog and Magog in London and  the names of Tobal and Moskoa, occuring in the Bible, are clear indications of this fact.  Next we come to the statement that the tribes found by Darius between Azerbaijan  and the Armenian mountains were constantly harassed by their northern neighbours, the  Scythians. History bears evidence to the truth of this statement. The Scythians, or,  according to some writers, the Sacae, constantly troubled Asia. According to Herodotus  the Scyths ruled Media for twenty-eight years (En. Br., Art. “Scythia”). “About 512  Darius undertook a war against the Scythians ... The purpose of this war can only have  been to attack the nomadic Turanian tribes in the rear, and thus to secure peace on the  northern frontier of the empire” (En. Br., Art. “Darius”). The portion which I give in  italics shows that Darius exerted himself to his utmost in securing peace on the northern  frontier of his empire, where the Caucasus, bounded on both sides by the Black and  Caspian Seas, afforded a natural protection.  The barrier referred to in this verse, and described in the verses that follow, is the  famous wall at Derbent (Ar. Darband). An account of this wall is given by Muslim  geographers and historians, for instance, in Mara©id al-IΔΔilå‘ and Ibn al-Faqßh. The  following account, however, taken from the Encyclopaedia Britannica, should be more  convincing: “Derbent or Darband, a town of Caucasia, in the province of Daghestan, on  the western shore of the Caspian ... It occupies a narrow strip of land beside the sea,  from which it climbs up the steep heights inland ... And to the south lies the seaward  extremity of the Caucasian wall (50 miles long), otherwise known as Alexander’s Wall,  blocking up the narrow pass of the Iron Gate or Caspian Gate (Portae Albanae, or  Portae Caspae). This, when enitre, had a height of 29 feet and a thickness of about 10  feet, and with its iron gates and numerous watch-towers formed a valuable defence of  the Persian frontier.” (Italics in the last sentence are mine, for which see the next footnote.) The misnomer Alexander’s Wall seems to have been due to the mistake made by  Muslim historians in supposing Dhu-l-qarnain to be Alexander.  /n/n  96a. The blocks of iron were needed for the iron gates in the wall, for which see the  concluding lines of the last note.  /n/n 98a. From the historical narration of the past, the subject is now changed to the  future. Gog and Magog are described as two nations, and after describing the history of  these nations, whose depredations on peaceful nations were brought to an end by Darius,  we are now told that Gog and Magog will again be let loose in the latter days. In fact,  this is clearly foretold in another chapter of the same period: “when Gog and Magog are  let loose, and they sally forth from every elevated place” (21:96). This is the only other  occasion on which Gog and Magog are spoken of in the Holy Qur’ån. The crumbling of  the wall which withheld Gog and Magog for a time is thus explained by the Qur’ån  itself, as the letting loose of Gog and Magog. Just as the building of the wall indicated  the confinement of Gog and Magog to their own territorial bounds, the crumbling of the  wall means that they will at some future time be let loose and they will then dominate  the whole world. This domination is spoken of in the Ïadßth in various ways. According  to one ƒadßth, “No one will have the power to fight against them” (Ms. 52:20).  According to another, “they will drink the water of the whole world” (KU, vol. 7,  p. 2157). According to a third, God said: “I have created some of My servants whom no  one can destroy but Myself ” (KU, p. 3021). As shown in 94a, the ancestors of Gog and  Magog are the Slav and Teutonic races, and in the world-domination of Gog and Magog  is thus clearly hinted the domination of the European nations over the whole world, and  the prophecy has thus found fulfilment in our days. /n/n 99a. A mighty conflict of the nations is clearly spoken of here, and the words no  doubt refer to some catastrophe like that which is predicted in the Gospels in the words:  “For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be  famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in diverse places. All these are the beginning  of sorrows” (Matt. 24:7, 8).  The Qur’ån makes it clear that the reference in nation rising against nation is to the  great European conflicts which we are witnessing nowadays. Gog and Magog, or the  European nations, having subdued the whole world, could not agree on the division of  the spoils, and they are rushing at one another’s throats, and the whole world being subject to them, their struggle has assumed the form of a world conflict. One World-War  ends only to be followed by another. But if the first part of the verse speaks of the  destruction due to these wars, the second part raises a great hope. Will this great worldconflict bring the world to an end? Human efforts to restore the balance to the world are  a failure. But the Qur’ån tells us that a mighty Revolution will come about. That is what  is meant by the blowing of the trumpet. This revolution will be a change in the mentality  of the nations. A silver lining is introduced in this dark picture by the words, then We  shall gather them all together. The revolution would unite them; it would drive them to  one common faith. Material benefits having turned man into the enemy of man, a spiritual awakening will, we are told, be brought about which will change the world entirely.  Instead of cutting one another’s throats men will learn to love one another, and they will  all be but one nation. There is a broad enough hint here at the nation of Islåm, for there  is but one faith, the faith of Islåm, which has been able to weld diverse people into one  whole. The day of peace for this world will dawn with the dawning of the idea on the  mind of man that there is only a single nation, the human nation, that lives on this earth:  “Mankind is a single nation” (2:213). And actually Islåm is the only religion in  the world which has been successful in uniting different nations into one whole and in  obliterating distinctions of race and colour. /n/n 100a. These words complete the picture of the great conflict spoken of in the previous verse. It in fact describes the severity of the conflict, it will reduce the world to a  veritable hell. We have seen hell raging on this earth in World-War II. What World-War  III may bring, no one can say. /n/n 101a. The reason is given in these words why these disasters will be brought on  man: These are people whose eyes are under a cover from My Reminder. Nay, they are  so estranged from God that they cannot even bear to hear His Reminder. So thoroughly  have lust and greed engrossed the civilized world! /n/n 102a. The Christians are meant here, because theirs is the most prominent example  of having taken a servant of Allåh, a prophet, for God. In fact, Jesus Christ is the only  person whom the Qur’ån recognizes as a righteous servant of God and who has been  taken for God by nearly half the world.  /n/n 104a. This is a clear description of the present attitude of the civilized nations to their  moral and spiritual needs — their effort is entirely wasted in this world’s life, and they  cannot give a moment’s consideration to the life after death. The portrait of the material  civilization, to which Christianity has led, as drawn in this section, attains to its most vivid  clearness in these words. Manufacture is the one speciality and pride of the West. But they  are so engrossed in the contest of manufactures that they have no thought of God left in  their minds. Production and more production, that is the be-all and end-all of life with them.  /n/n 105a. Their works are vain because what they do relates to the vanities of life. They  have no vision for the higher values of life, for the ultimate end, which is here spoken of as  the meeting with the Lord. Hence we are told that no balance will be set up for them on the  day of Resurrection, because all their deeds relate to this life, and end where this life ends. /n/n 109a. In these words there is a refutation of the Christian doctrine that “the  word was with God”, or that “the word was God” (John 1:1). The words of God are so  numerous, we are here told, that the sea would be exhausted, if it were to serve as ink for  writing them. In fact, everything created is a word of God according to the Holy Qur’ån,  and things created know no end."
