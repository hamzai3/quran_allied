    {
      "note": "1a. This verse is to be read along with v. 4, which makes a clear exception in favourof those who did not fail in their agreements. It is a fact that the idolatrous tribes ofArabia broke their agreements with the Muslims again and again (8:56), yet theMuslims were enjoined to accept peace if the disbelievers consented to it, even afterrepeated violations (8:61). But this state of things could not continue long, for it wassoon found that it was impossible to trust such neighbours. This repudiation of agreements took place on a large scale when the Muslims were absent on the Tab∂k expedition. The first thirteen verses of this chapter were publicly proclaimed by ‘Alß, on theoccasion of the pilgrimage in the ninth year of the Hijrah, and the following announcements made as the result: (1) that no idolater shall approach the Sacred House after this;(2) that no one shall go naked round the Ka‘bah (B. 65: ix, 3). The attitude of the tribesto whom this ultimatum was given through ‘Alß is well indicated in their reply: “O ‘Alß,deliver this message to thy cousin (i.e. the Prophet), that we have thrown the agreementsbehind our backs, and there is no agreement between him and us except smiting withspears and striking with swords” (Rz).\n\n3a. By the day of the greater pilgrimage is meant either the ninth of Dhu-l-Ïijjah,when all pilgrims gather together in the plain of ‘Arafåt, or the tenth when they assemble in Minå.\n\n4a. Only two tribes, the Banß Óamrah, and the Banß Kanånah, are related to haveadhered to their treaties. The exception given here makes it clear that the Muslims werenot fighting with the idolaters on account of their religion, but on account of their havingbeen untrue to their engagements.\n\n5a. The clear exception of the last verse shows that by the idolaters here are meant,not all idolaters or polytheists wherever they may be found in the world, not even allidolaters of Arabia, but only those idolatrous tribes of Arabia assembled at the pilgrimage who had first made agreements with the Muslims and then violated them.\n\n5b. The exception here has given rise to much misconception. It is thought that itoffers to the disbelievers the alternative of the sword or the Qur’ån. Nothing is fartherfrom the truth. The injunction contained in the first part of the verse establishes the factthat the whole verse relates to certain idolatrous Arab tribes who had broken theirengagements with the Muslims, and who had now been apprised of a similar repudiationby the Muslims. The order to kill them and to make them prisoners and to besiege themand ambush them amounts clearly to an order to fight against them, as it is in war onlythat all these things are made lawful. They had so often broken their word that theycould no more be trusted. Yet, if they joined the brotherhood of Islåm, and there was anabsolute change in their condition, the punishment which they otherwise deserved couldbe remitted. It was a case of forgiving a guilty people who had repented. It should alsobe noted that a mere confession of the faith is not required; what is required isan absolute change, so that the old crimes are all abandoned. Therefore, along with theconfession of the faith, it is required that they should keep up prayer and pay the poorrate. The subject is further clarified in the next verse and the following section.\n\n6a. This verse leaves no doubt that the Prophet was never ordered to kill anyone onaccount of his religion. “You shall give him a safe conduct that he may return homeagain securely in case he shall not think fit to embrace Muhammadanism” (Sale).\n\n7a.  So long as the idolaters were true to their agreements, the Muslims wererequired to be true to them. Just as in the case of war, the Muslims were not allowed tofight until the enemy had first attacked, so, in the case of repudiation of agreements, itwas the enemy who first repudiated the agreement.\n\n10a. Note the repeated assertions of the Qur’ån that the disbelievers were not to befought against for their disbelief but for their being first in starting war or repudiatingagreements. No remedy was left for the covert mischief of these people, except that theagreements should be overtly repudiated and a period put to all their mischief.\n\n12a. Note, again, that those leaders of disbelief are to be fought against who breaktheir oaths after their agreements.\n\n15a. It is said to refer to the Khuzå‘ah, who, having become Muslims, sufferedseverely at the hands of the Banß Bakr, assisted by the Quraish; but the reference may aswell be to the Muslims in general, who had suffered the severest persecutions at thehands of the disbelievers. The punishment of the persecutors would no doubt relieve thehearts of the believers.\n\n17a. By the mosques of Allåh is meant particularly the Sacred Mosque at Makkah,as being the centre of all the mosques of the world. This is made clear by the use of thewords Sacred Mosque in v. 19 instead of the mosques of Allåh. It had long remained inthe hands of the idolaters, who abode therein, visiting and repairing it, having placed alarge number of idols within it. With the conquest of Makkah the Sacred Mosque wasdenuded of all idols, and was now as pure an emblem of monotheism as in the time ofAbraham. Hence the idol-worshippers had nothing to do with it now.\n\n19a. It is generally supposed to refer to ‘Abbås, the Prophet’s uncle, whose chargewas giving drink to pilgrims and guarding the Sacred Mosque. But really a comparisonis drawn here between all such minor acts of charity and public utility and the greatresponsibility of every individual to exert himself to his utmost to establish the Truth.\n\n24a. A true Muslim may have wealth, may carry on trade, may have magnificenthouses, but these should not be dearer to him than Allåh and exertion in His path. Inother words, he should be ready to sacrifice all these interests for a higher purpose,before which all these sink into insignificance. The essential difference between theGospel teaching and the teaching of the Holy Qur’ån is that while the former condemnswealth and the amassing of wealth outright, the latter does not require one actually tohate riches, but rather not to be obsessed by wealth to the neglect of one’s higher dutiesand responsibilities. The acquisition of wealth is not harmful so long as it is not madethe real aim of life, but has its proper place as the means to an end.\n\n25a. With the declaration of immunity, there would naturally be an apprehension inthe minds of the Muslims that the struggle would grow harder. Hence they are given anassurance of Divine help, amply justified by their previous experience.The battle of Ïunain, fought in the eighth year of the Hijrah in the valley of Ïunain,at about three miles from Makkah, differed from the other battles inasmuch as theMuslims here outnumbered the enemy, the tribes of Hawåzin and Thaqßf being about4,000 strong, while the Muslims are said to have been as many as ten or even twelvethousand. The archers of the enemy were good marksmen, and had occupied strongpositions in the mountain passes. The Muslim army, on the other hand, contained twothousand men of Makkah, some of them still adhering to idolatry. Unfortunately thiswas the advance party of the army, and, unable to face the archers, they retreated causing disorder to the whole army. The Prophet, however, led the assault, at first alone, inface of the archers, but was soon joined by others and a victory was obtained, as the nextverse shows.\n\n27a. The reference may be to the prisoners of the Hawåzin, who numbered thousands, and who were all set free as an act of favour by the Holy Prophet, or to their ultimately coming over to Islåm.\n\n28a. Because they indulged in evil practices and went naked round the Ka‘bah.Compare 5:90, where idols are declared to be unclean.\n\n28b. The year of the proclamation, i.e. the ninth year of the Hijrah.\n\n28c.  The importance of Makkah as a commercial centre lay in the fact that thewhole of Arabia repaired to it in the season of the pilgrimage, and there carried outimportant commercial transactions. The prohibition referred to in the first part of theverse could have been easily foreseen as affecting the commerce, and consequently theprosperity of Makkah, but worldly or business considerations never interfered with thecarrying out of the moral reforms of Islåm.\n\n29a. The last word on the wars with the idolaters of Arabia having been said, thisverse introduces the subject of fighting with the followers of the Book. Though the Jewshad for a long time assisted the idolatrous Arabians in their struggle to uproot Islåm, thegreat Christian power, the Roman Empire, had only just mobilized its forces for the subjection of the new religion, and the Tab∂k expedition followed, which constitutes thesubject-matter of a large portion of what follows in this chapter. As the object of thisChristian power was simply the subjection of the Muslims, the words in which theirfinal vanquishment by the Muslims is spoken of are different from those dealing withthe final vanquishment of the idolatrous Arabians. The Qur’ån neither required that theidolaters should be compelled to accept Islåm, nor was it in any way its object to bringthe Christians into subjection. On the other hand, the idolaters wanted to suppress Islåmby the sword, and the Christians first moved themselves to bring Muslim Arabia undersubjection. The fate of each was, therefore, according to what it intended for theMuslims. The word jizyah is derived from jazå, meaning he gave satisfaction, andmeans, according to LL, the tax that is taken from the free non-Muslim subjects of theMuslim Government whereby they ratify the compact that ensures them protection; or,according to AH, because it is a compensation for the protection which is guaranteedthem, the non-Muslim subjects being free from military service.The phrase ‘an yad-in has been explained variously. The word yad (lit., hand) standsfor power or superiority, the use of the hand being the real source of the superiority of manover all other animals, and the apparent meaning of the phrase is in acknowledgement ofyour superiority in protecting their lives, etc. (AH). It may also be added that the permission to fight, as given to the Muslims, is subject to the condition that the enemy should firsttake up the sword, Fight in the way of Allåh against those who fight against you(2:190). The Holy Prophet never overstepped this limit, nor did his followers. He foughtagainst the Arabs when they took up the sword to destroy the Muslims, and he led an expedition against the Christians when the Roman Empire first mobilized its forces with theobject of subjugating the Muslims. And so scrupulous was he that, when he found that theenemy had not yet taken the initiative, he did not attack the Roman Empire, but returnedwithout fighting. Later on, however, the Roman Empire, like the Persians, helped the enemies of Islåm and fomented trouble against the newly established Muslim Kingdom, as aresult of which both these empires came into conflict with the Muslims and, notwithstanding the fact that both the Persians and the Romans were very powerful nations with unlimited resources and strong military organizations, and that they both tried at one and the sametime to subjugate Islåm, the result was what is predicted here in clear words — they wereboth reduced to a state of subjection by an insignificant nation like the Arabs.\n\n30a. That there was a sect among the Jews who raised Ezra to the dignity of godhead,or son of God, is shown by Muslim historians. QasΔalånß says, in the Kitåb al-Nikåƒ, thatthere was a party of Jews who held this belief. Nor did the Jews deny this allegation. TheQur’ån, too, mentions it only here in connection with the Christian doctrine, never blamingthe Jews directly in the many controversies with them in the earlier chapters, and thisshows that the Jewish nation as a whole was not guilty of entertaining this belief.Another explanation of the statement made here is the free use of the word son.Elsewhere the Qur’ån says of the Jews and the Christians that they call themselves thesons of Allåh and His beloved ones (5:18), the meaning only being that they consideredthemselves special favourites of the Divine Being. Hence the belief regarding Ezra maybe interpreted in the same light, for there is clear evidence that the Talmudists used veryexaggerated language concerning him. Among the prophets of Israel, Ezra was speciallyhonoured. In Rabbinical literature Ezra was considered “worthy of being the vehicle ofthe law, had it not been already given through Moses”. “He is regarded and quoted asthe type of person most competent and learned in the law. The Rabbis associate hisname with several important institutions” (Jewish Encyclopaedia).\n\n30b. We are here told that the Christian doctrine that Jesus Christ was the son ofGod was borrowed from earlier pagan people. Recent research has established the factbeyond all doubt. In fact, when St. Paul saw that the Jews would on no account acceptJesus Christ as a messenger of God, he introduced the pagan doctrine of sonship of Godinto the Christian religion, so that it might become more acceptible to the pagans.\n\n31a. Most of the commentators agree that it does not mean that they took them actually for gods; the meaning is that they followed them blindly in what they enjoined andwhat they forbade, and therefore they are described as having taken them for lords, onaccount of attaching to them a Divine dignity. It is related in a ƒadßth that, when thisverse was revealed, ‘Adß ibn Ïåtim, a convert from Christianity, asked the Holy Prophetas to the significance of this verse, for, he said, we did not worship our doctors of law andmonks. The Holy Prophet’s reply was: Was it not that the people considered lawful whattheir priests declared to be lawful, though it was forbidden by God. Ïåtim replied in theaffirmative. That, the Prophet said, was what the verse meant (Tr. 44:9; IJ). Muslims whoaccord a similar position to their pßrs or saints are guilty of the same error.\n\n32a. This is a prophecy of the ultimate triumph of Islåm in face of severe oppositionfrom the Jews and Christians. All opposition to truth, whether based on force or propaganda,is here compared with putting out the Divine light by blowing with the mouth to showthat all such attempts would prove futile. The Divine light will be made perfect, by whichis meant the triumph of Islåm throughout the world, as the next verse states clearly.\n\n33a. The prophecy of the ultimate triumph of Islåm in the whole world is repeatedthrice in the Holy Qur’ån, in exactly the same words — here and in 48:28 and 61:9.Here as well as in 61:9 it is mentioned in connection with Christianity, while in 48:28, itis mentioned in connection with the Arab opposition to Islåm. In Arabia itself, Islåmbecame triumphant in the lifetime of the Holy Prophet. Idolatry was wiped out from theface of the country, while many of the Jews and Christians accepted the Religion ofTruth. The Prophet’s death, instead of putting any check to the advance of Islåm, was asignal for an unparalleled advance of his religion. The first century of the Muslim erasaw, not only vast Christian communities swelling the ranks of Islåm, in Egypt, NorthAfrica, Asia Minor, Persia and Central Asia, but also brought to light the amazing factthat Islåm, coming in contact with all the great religions of the world, withZoroastrianism in Persia, with Buddhism and Hinduism in India and Afghanistan, andwith Confucianism in China, conquered the hearts of the followers of every religion andthey accepted the message of Truth in vast numbers, so that great Muslim communitiessprang up in the whole known world, and the light of Islåm enlightened the whole worldfrom the farthest East to the farthest West.The reason for this triumph, unprecedented in the history of religion, is not far toseek. It was the Religion of Truth; it presented the whole truth and infused a new life intoall people who accepted it, while every other religion presented only partial truth. Everyreligion accepted this or that prophet, while Islåm accepted all the prophets of the world,and every religion had obscured the great Truth of Divine Unity by mixing up with itsome kind of shirk, while Islåm presented the purest monotheism. Islåm thus presentingthe Perfect Light of Divine Unity and the whole Truth relating to prophethood appealed toevery people, and the truth of the words — He it is Who has sent His Messenger with theguidance and the Religion of Truth that He may make it prevail over all religions — shoneout in full resplendence. Yet we are told in reliable ƒadßth that even a greater manifestation of the fulfilment of these words will be witnessed in the latter days when the Messiahof this ummah makes his appearance (IJ, Rz). And the final manifestation of this greattruth is foreshadowed in the gradual acceptance of the principles of Islåm throughout thewhole world, notwithstanding the fact that the political power of Islåm is at its lowest ebb.\n\n34a. The acquisition of wealth is not disallowed, but the hoarding of it so as not tospend it in the cause of truth and for the welfare of humanity is denounced.\n\n35a. The punishment of an evil is spoken of throughout the Holy Qur’ån as similarto the evil. Even in this world, a man feels a torment similar to the nature of the evil inwhich he indulges. Being branded with the hoarded wealth is thus a fit description of thechastisement of the hoarders.\n\n36a.  The allusion here is to the Arab practice of postponing the pilgrimage to amonth other than that in which it fell, for which see the next verse. Whether the objectwas intercalation, in order to make the solar and lunar year tally, or whether a continuous cessation of war for a fourth part of the year was too long, is a disputed point; butsuch postponement was undoubtedly a great hardship for a majority of the people.\n\n36b.  Fighting was prohibited in the sacred months (2:217). Excepting this, theMuslims were told to fight with the idolaters as the idolaters fought with them, i.e. sinceall idolaters united in fighting with the Muslims, the latter, too, should unite in fightingwith them.\n\n37a. According to most of the commentators, nasß’ means postponement, and thereference here is to the practice of postponing observance of the sacred month, thusallowing an ordinary month to be observed as sacred and a sacred month to be treated asordinary. This practice interfered with the security of life which was guaranteed in thesacred months, and is, therefore, denounced. According to others, nasß’ means addition(of a month), and refers to the practice of the intercalation of a month every fourthyear. AH prefers the first, and says that the three successive months of Dhu-l-Qa‘dah,Dhu-l-Ïijjah and Muƒarram seemed too long for them to refrain from their depredationsand bloodshed, and therefore they violated the last of these, keeping sacred instead thenext month.\n\n38a. The reference here is to the expedition of Tab∂k, which was undertaken in themiddle of the ninth year of the Hijrah owing to the threatening attitude of the RomanEmperor. There were many hindrances to the raising of an army sufficient to meet thestrong forces of the Roman Empire. The chief of these, as enumerated by Rz, are: (1) agreat drought; (2) the length of the journey to the confines of Syria; (3) the ripening ofthe fruits, which were now ready to be gathered; (4) the intensity of the heat; and (5) theorganization and power of the Roman army. In spite of all these difficulties 30,000 mengathered round the Prophet’s banner.\n\n39a. The reference here and in what follows is to certain men, who, while professing belief, hesitated to accept the Prophet’s call to get ready for the expedition.\n\n40a. This refers to the Prophet’s flight from Makkah, when he was forced to hidehimself in a cave called Thaur, about three miles from Makkah, with only one companion, Ab∂ Bakr. The believers are told that Allåh saved the Prophet from the hands of hisenemies when he had but one companion amidst a whole nation of enemies, and thatAllåh would help him now.Ab∂ Bakr’s devotion to the Holy Prophet was so great that the latter chose him to behis “sole companion”, the second of the two, in that most critical hour of his life. Thefollowing account from Muir will explain the reference: “He himself went straightwayto the house of Ab∂ Bakr, and after a short consultation ventured the plan for immediateflight. Ab∂ Bakr shed tears of joy; the hour of emigration had at last arrived, and he wasto be the companion of the Prophet’s journey ... They crept in the shade of the eveningthrough a back window, and escaped unobserved from the southern suburb. Pursuingtheir way south, and clambering in the dark up the bare and rugged ascent, they reachedat last the lofty peak of Mount Thaur, distant about an hour and a half from the city, andtook refuge in a cavern near its summit ... The sole companion, or in Arabic phraseologythe second of the two, became one of Ab∂ Bakr’s most honoured titles ... Muƒammadand his companion felt it no doubt to be a time of jeopardy. Glancing upwards at acrevice through which the morning light began to break, Ab∂ Bakr whispered: ‘What ifone were to look through the chink and see us underneath his very feet!’ ‘Think not thus,Ab∂ Bakr!’ said the Prophet, ‘We are two, but God is in the midst a third.’ ”\n\n41a. That is, whether it is easy or difficult for you to proceed or whether you aresufficiently armed or not.\n\n42a. Tab∂k was midway between Madßnah and Damascus. The Arabs were accustomed to fighting near home; hence, the distance was one of the chief considerationswhich held back those who were insincere.\n\n43a. ‘Afa-llåhu ‘an-ka (lit., Allåh pardon thee), does not convey the significance ofpardon of sins; it is rather the equivalent of Allåh bless thee! or may Allåh set thy affairsaright! In previous battles, too, the hypocrites always stayed away, offering one excuse oranother. But the Divine purpose in this last expedition of the Prophet was to bring about aclear distinction, and to clean the Muslim society of the hypocritical elementthoroughly. Such a distinction was really brought about later on as vv. 83, 84 point out, theProphet being told there that all spiritual relations with the hypocrites were to be cut off.\n\n47a. These verses were revealed during the journey to Tab∂k, where most of thehypocrites themselves were not present. But a few had accompanied the expedition toinform others of their party of the happenings on the way.\n\n52a. The two most excellent things are, the laying down of life in the cause of Truth,or being sharer in the ultimate triumph of Truth. The Muslims never thought that theycould be defeated. They would either die defending the cause of Truth or live and conquer.The only punishment that the hypocrites received from the hands of the Muslimswas that they were named and asked to leave the mosque (IJ). Otherwise their libertywas not interfered with. There is mention of one of them living in Madßnah to the timeof ‘Uthmån, the third Caliph, in full enjoyment of his rights as a citizen; the only distinctive treatment mentioned of him is that the poor-rate was not accepted from him by theHoly Prophet, or by his three immediate successors. See also the next verse.\n\n55a. The hypocrites experienced earthly torture about their property and children fortwo reasons: (1) because, avowing their belief in Islåm, they had to take some share inits defensive expeditions and thus spend part of their property, unwillingly though itwas, in the cause of Islåm; (2) the children of many of them were true believers, andthey knew that after their death their property and their children were to become asource of strength to the very religion which they tried to extirpate.\n\n60a. That by ©adaqåt in the opening of the verse is meant the obligatory charity,called zakåt, and not voluntary alms, is shown by the concluding words of the verse,which call it an ordinance from Allåh. The verse defines the objects for which the poorrate may be spent. Altogether eight heads of expenditure are recognized. There are thepoor, or those in straitened circumstances; then there are the needy, by which are meantpeople who need some help to enable them to earn their living. Poor students and craftsmen or business men without sufficient means are included in this category. Thirdly,there are the collectors of zakåt and other people employed to administer the funds. Thisshows that the institution was meant for raising a public fund, whose management shouldentirely be in the hands of a public body. The Qur’ån does not recognize it as a privatecharity. It is sad to note that, as the Qur’ån would have it, the institution of zakåt isentirely neglected by the Muslims. In the fourth class are people whose hearts are madeto incline to Truth. With respect to the preaching of a religion there is always a classwhich is ready to listen but the carrying of the message of Truth to them needsfunds. There are also people who may need help, if they accept the Truth. Expenses inthis connection are recognized here as a part of the necessary expenditure of poorrate. The fifth head relates to the freeing of the prisoners of war. Islåm thus laid down apermanent basis for the abolition of slavery. The sixth class is that of debtors — peoplewho incur debts for right purposes. Islåm requires all the members of the society to livein a free atmosphere, and those burdened with debt must therefore be freed of their burdens. Squanderers of wealth are, however, not included in this category. The seventhhead is in general words, fß sabßl Allåh, or in the way of Allåh. Some limit the significance of these words to warriors (fighting in defence of faith and the community), orthose who are engaged in propagating Islamic truths, while others think that the wordsare general and include every charitable purpose. The eighth head is that of wayfarers,people who are stranded in a country, to whatever religion or nation they may belong.\n\n61a. The word udhun, lit., an ear, is applied to one who hears and believes everything that is said to him, “as though by reason of the excess of his listening he were altogether the organ of hearing, like as a spy is termed ‘ain” (lit., eye) (LL). The hypocritesmade various derogatory remarks concerning the Prophet, saying among other things,that he was a man who believed everything that he heard, and they were therefore surethat they would make him believe their hypocritical professions. Rodwell is wrong whenhe says in his note on this word that udhun means injure. Palmer has also made a mistake here. The error is due to the confusion of the word with adh-an, which is quite adifferent word, being from the root adhå.\n\n62a. Though Allåh and His Messenger are both mentioned together, the duty of thefaithful is here said to be to please Him, i.e. Allåh alone.\n\n66a. History shows that most of the hypocrites ultimately repented and sincerelyjoined the ranks of the faithful.\n\n73a.  Jåhada signifies he strove or exerted himself, and jihåd is the using one’sutmost power in contending with an object of disapprobation (LL). It is in a secondarysense that the word signifies fighting, and it is repeatedly used in the Holy Qur’ån in itsprimary significance. It is a fact that those who professed Islåm were never foughtagainst, even though their professions were insincere — as on this occasion and on theoccasion of the battle of Uƒud. “The correct rendering is that jihåd signifies striving, orexerting oneself, and there is nothing in the word to indicate that this striving is to beeffected by the sword or by the tongue or by any other method” (Rz).The Prophet is commanded here to carry on a jihåd against disbelievers as well ashypocrites. Hence the only significance that can be attached to these words is that hemust continue to preach forcibly both to the disbelievers and the hypocrites.\n\n74a. They were in secret alliance with the enemies of Islåm and did their best to putan end to the life of the Prophet and bring about the extirpation of Islåm.\n\n74b. The advent of the Muslims in Madßnah had enriched its inhabitants. Was it not,then, a matter for wonder that those men who had gained by Islåm should turn againsttheir very benefactors?\n\n79a.  When subscriptions were raised for the expedition to Tab∂k, the wealthiermembers of the Muslim community gave large donations, while the poorer ones, thelabourers, also paid their mite out of their hard earnings. The hypocrites taunted both,the former as making a show of their wealth, the latter as bringing in their small subscriptions only to be counted among the subscribers. For Allåh’s paying them back theirmockery, see 2:15a.\n\n80a. Spiritual relations with the hypocrites were henceforth cut off. The mention ofseventy may not indicate the specific number here. For this use of the word see 2:29b. It,however, appears that the Holy Prophet took it literally at the burial service of ‘Abd Allåhibn Ubayy, the recognized leader of the hypocrites. When ‘Abd Allåh ibn Ubayy died,the Holy Prophet was asked to conduct the burial service. The Holy Prophet got up, but‘Umar took hold of his garment and objected on the ground that ‘Abd Allåh was a hypo -crite, and referred to his hostile attitude throughout his life. The Holy Prophet replied thatAllåh had given him a choice (referring to the words of this verse: Ask forgiveness forthem or ask not forgiveness for them), and that he would ask forgiveness for him for overseventy times, if only by his doing so, forgiveness could be extended to the dead man.Then he offered prayers for him. Verse 84 is said to have been revealed then to stop theoffering of prayers for those who were known to be hypocrites (B. 23:84).The incident shows how kind and forgiving the Holy Prophet was to his severestenemies. ‘Abd Allåh ibn Ubayy was the man who had led the hypocrite movement againsthim the whole of his life, and thus was not only one of his worst enemies, but at the sametime a most dangerous one, because he was aware of all the movements of the Muslims anddeceived them at the most critical moments. Yet the Holy Prophet forgave him entirely.\n\n83a. It should be noted that this is the only punishment given to the hypocrites, viz.,that they were not allowed to take part in future expeditions against the enemies of theMuslims. It is also related that from one of them, Tha‘labah, whose story is referred toby the commentators under v. 75, the Holy Prophet and the three Caliphs who followedhim refused to accept the poor-rate. V. 103 leads us to the same conclusion; see 103a.These were the only disadvantages, if it is right to call them so, which the hypocritessuffered. They were not looked upon as members of the Muslim community, but, ascitizens, they enjoyed all the rights of other citizens.\n\n84a.  The Prophet is now told that, though they professed Islåm outwardly, theywere disbelievers at heart, and the burial service, which was only for the Muslims,should not be extended to them. But it should be noted that the Prophet was nowinformed through Divine revelation that they were really disbelievers. It is, further, clearfrom the words of this verse that those who were known to be hypocrites were notfought against but lived to die a natural death. The case of ‘Abd Allåh ibn Ubayy, whodied in the lifetime of the Holy Prophet, and that of Tha‘labah, who died in the reign of‘Uthmån, are sufficient to prove this, while there is not a single case on record of anyone of them having been put to death.Standing by the grave refers to the Prophet’s practice of praying for the deceasedstanding by his grave after the burial.\n\n90a. The word mu‘adhdhir is the nominative form of ‘adhdhara, meaning he wasremiss, wanting, deficient in an affair, setting up an excuse for it (LA).\n\n90b. Al-A‘råb is a collective general noun, said by Az to be plural of a‘råbß (LL),signifying the dwellers of the desert (of Arabia), who move from place to place in searchof herbage and water, whether of Arabs or their freemen, as distinguished from ‘Arab,which signifies those whose descent can be traced to Arabs (LA).\n\n92a.  Apparently, what they wanted to join the expedition, and what the Prophetcould not find for them, were beasts to ride upon and to carry their provisions and necessaries.\n\n94a. Evidently these verses were revealed when the Prophet was away fromMadßnah, and the statements made in them are therefore prophetical, being exactlyfulfilled on his return.\n\n95a. It is related that on his return from Tab∂k, the Holy Prophet forbade theMuslims to have any intercourse with the hypocrites. This injunction was in obedience tothe revelation which he had received during the journey, as is clearly shown in vv. 83, 84.\n\n98a. The hypocrites had to contribute something for the sake of appearance; theyalso paid the poor-rate so that they might be treated as Muslims.Då’irah (pl. dawå’ir) means circuit, and a calamity is so called because it encompasses a man on all sides; or it signifies a turn of fortune, from dåra, meaning it turned.Då’irat al-sau’ is the calamity which befalls and destroys (LL). It is a propheticalannouncement.\n\n100a. Muhåjirßn is plural of muhåjir, meaning literally one who flees from or forsakes his home, and an©år is plural of nå©ir, meaning one who helps. In the history ofIslåm, the former word came to signify all those companions of the Holy Prophet who,having embraced Islåm at Makkah, had to flee from their homes either to Abyssinia or toMadßnah; the latter flight, including nearly all the Makkan Muslims, is known as theFlight, and the Muslim era dates from it. An©år signifies the Madßnah Muslims who,having accepted Islåm before the Flight, gave shelter to those who fled from Makkah.By “those who followed them in goodness” are meant the Muslims who came after thecompanions and followed their good deeds.\n\n101a. The insincerity of the heart could not be known to a mortal — it is knownonly to Allåh. Events had, however, come to pass which ultimately separated thehypocrites from the Muslims after they had been mingled with them for a long time.\n\n101b. The hypocrites were punished twice in this life. They had to take part in allcontributions for the defence of the Muslim community and had to pay the poor-rate, allthis against their conviction and unwillingly, and this was, no doubt, a source of greattorment to them. After having suffered all this torment for the sake of being reckonedMuslims, they were ultimately separated from the Muslims, for it is reported that theHoly Prophet named them while addressing a congregation in the Friday prayers, andthey had to leave the assembly in the sight of the whole congregation, and this exposureto public shame was no doubt a great punishment for them.\n\n102a. According to different reports, the number of these men varied from three toten. They were sincere and acknowledged their fault.\n\n103a. Because they showed sincerity in confessing their faults, they were dealt withleniently. Their alms were not to be rejected. The Prophet’s acceptance of alms fromthem is here spoken of as purifying them of evil, while his prayer for them is describedas bringing peace and quiet to them.\n\n106a. This is generally supposed to refer to three of the believers, who held backfrom the expedition, viz. Ka‘b ibn Målik, Halål ibn Umayyah and Murårah ibn Rabß‘(B. 64:81). But some think that it refers to the hypocrites generally.\n\n107a.  According to I‘Ab and other commentators, twelve men from amongthe hypocrites of the tribe of of Banß Ghanam built a mosque at the instigation of Ab∂‘Åmir in the neighbourhood of the mosque of Qubå’, with the object of causing harm tothat mosque. Ab∂ ‘Åmir, who after fighting against the Holy Prophet for a long time,had fled to Syria after the battle of Ïunain, had written to his friends at Madßnah that hewas coming with a formidable army to crush the Prophet, and that they should build amosque for him. But Ab∂ ‘Åmir died in Syria, and the founders desired the HolyProphet to give it a blessing by his presence, which he was forbidden to do by Divinerevelation, and the mosque was demolished (AH).\n\n108a. Some commentators understand by this the mosque at Qubå’, while thegreater number regard the Prophet’s mosque at Madßnah as being meant here. The wordsare general and every mosque raised for the service of Allåh may be included in thisdescription.\n\n110a. Their hearts could be torn to pieces by severe regret or by sincere repentance.\n\n111a. The promise which is said to be binding on Allåh, as laid down in the Qur’ån,as well as in the previous books, is this, that Allåh will grant the believers His blessings,if they exert themselves with their persons and their property in His way: “Allåh hasbought from the believers their persons and their property — theirs (in return) is theGarden”. The Gospels give the same promise: “If thou wilt be perfect,” said Jesus to awealthy man, “go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me” (Matt. 19:21). “Behold, we have forsaken alland followed thee; what shall we have therefore?” said Peter. Jesus’ reply was: “Everyone that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, orchildren, or lands, for my name’s sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inheriteverlasting life” (Matt. 19:27–29). Moses’ teaching contains similar promises. Forinstance, the promise of God, “that ye may increase mightily ... in the land that flowethwith milk and honey,” is made conditional on “thou shalt love the Lord thy God with allthy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy might” (Deut. 6:3–5), which is the sameas exerting oneself to one’s utmost in the way of God with one’s person and property. Itshould be borne in mind that the words they fight in Allåh’s way, so they slay and areslain, are not a part of the promise, but are expressive of the condition of theCompanions, and show that they were true to their promise. The promise to spend one’sperson and property may be carried out in various ways under different circumstances,and the Companions of the Holy Prophet were as true to this promise during the thirteenyears at Makkah as during the ten years at Madßnah.\n\n113a. It should be noted that this verse does not prohibit praying for the forgivenessof the disbelievers in general, but only such disbelievers about whom it became clearthat they were doomed to the Fire. The commentators are generally of opinion thateither a revelation from Allåh with regard to a person or his death in disbelief or idolatryalone settles the point. When the Prophet was asked to pray for the destruction of a people who were fighting against him, he prayed thus: “My Lord, forgive them because theyknow not”. So long as a man is alive, however hard he may be in his disbelief, it is notforbidden to pray for his forgiveness or guidance. But when he is dead, God will dealwith him as He pleases, and He is the most Merciful of all merciful ones. According to aƒadßth, after all intercessions have taken place, the Most Merciful of all will take a handful — and the handful with God is as vast as the heavens and the earth (39:67) — out ofhell and throw them into the river of Life, and these would be the people who never didany good (B. 98:24). But under this verse the burial service, which is a prayer forforgiveness, is held only for Muslims, and not for those who die in disbelief.\n\n115a. The verse establishes in clear words that Allåh never leads a people astray;and how could He lead astray, says the Holy Qur’ån, when He it is Who gives themguidance, and makes clear to them the evils they should guard against?\n\n117a. Taubah on the part of Allåh means His turning to His servant and changing onestate to another which is higher than it. The context, in fact, throws clear light upon themeaning of taubah, for Allåh’s turning mercifully is in relation to the Prophet and thosesincere believers who are plainly stated to have followed the Prophet in the hour of straitness, thus showing that it was in relation to those who were obedient under the severestdifficulties and not to those who were disobedient; the latter being dealt with in the nextverse. The expedition to Tab∂k is known as the ghazwat al-‘usrah or the expedition ofstraitness, because of the excessive heat, and scarcity of food and water and the hardshipsof the long journey with scanty means. Really the whole period of about twenty-one yearsfrom the preaching of the Prophet had been one of the severest difficulties for theMuslims. The party whose hearts were about to deviate is referred to in the next verse.\n\n118a. The three men were from among the An©år, whose names have already beengiven in 106a. The words were left behind are explained as meaning either left behind atthe time of the expedition or left behind with respect to the commandment of Allåh concerning them, being, it is said, the persons referred to in v. 106: “And others are made toawait Allåh’s command, whether He chastise them or turn to them mercifully”. The latter explanation was given by Ka‘b himself, one of the three men (AH). They remainedcut off from all intercourse with the Muslims for fifty days. Ka‘b was a man of importance, and when he received a letter from the king of Ghassån, offering him aposition under him if he deserted the Prophet, he burned the letter, showing his contemptfor the offer, and gave no reply (Ibn Hishåm).\n\n120a. The meaning is that they should neither desire rest for themselves, nor comfort, nor protection, in preference to the Prophet; in other words, they should accompanyhim in difficulty and distress.\n\n120b. Nåla min-hu means he harmed him; nåla min ‘uduwwi-hß, he attained theobject of his desire from the enemy (LL).\n\n122a. The introduction here of the subject of the study of religion shows the aimwhich the Qur’ån has in view. In the midst of the ordinances relating to fighting, it introduces the subject of the preparation of a missionary force, thus showing that this was thegreatest necessity of Islåm. It was only by means of a missionary effort that truth couldbe spread, and the ultimate object was not to be lost sight of, even when the communitywas engaged in a life-and-death struggle against overwhelming forces of the enemy.\n\n123a.  Because it was they who persecuted the Muslims. The object was to stoppersecutions.\n\n123b. So that you do not yield to them.\n\n125a.  The uncleanness of their hearts increased with new revelation, because itincreased them in stubbornness, and their hearts were more and more hardened againsttruth.\n\n126a. These trials consisted of the expeditions which the Muslims had to undertakeevery now and then, and in which the hypocrites were distinguished from the truebelievers.\n\n128a. This is the true picture of the heart which grieved, not for his followers alone,not for one tribe or country, but for all humanity. He grieves for the burdens of all, andhe is solicitous for the welfare of all. That the whole of humanity is meant here is shownby the concluding words. There is a special relation he bears to those who follow him; tothem he is, in addition, compassionate and merciful."
