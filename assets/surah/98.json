	  "note": "1a. Both the People of the Book, people to whom revelation had been granted at someprevious time, and the idolaters of Arabia, among whom no prophet had ever appeared,were sunk so deep in immorality and sin that only a Divine Messenger could now free themfrom this bondage. The Jews and the Christians, one after another, had exerted themselvesto their utmost to reform Arabia, but both had failed. In fact they were themselves demoralized like the Arabs. “It was not until they heard the spirit-stirring strains of the ArabianProphet that they too awoke from their slumber, and sprang suddenly into a new and earnestlife” (Muir). That by the Clear Evidence is meant the Prophet is made clear in the nextverse, where this Clear Evidence is spoken of as being a Messenger from Allåh.\n\n2a. It should be noted that the Messenger is here described as reciting pure pages, thusshowing clearly that the Qur’ån existed in a written form at the time of the revelation ofthis chapter. Their designation as pure is to show that the Holy Qur’ån brought them out ofall impurities.\n\n3a. Kitåb (pl. kutab) means a book or an ordinance. Whichever significance may beadopted, the meaning of the passage is that all those right directions necessary for theguidance of man, whether previously revealed or not, are to be met with in the HolyQur’ån. The Qur’ån thus claims to contain all the good points of other sacred books,and, in addition, to supply their deficiencies.\n\n4a. The division mentioned here is the division into believers and disbelievers, someaccepting the Messenger and others rejecting him.\n\n8a. The companions of the Holy Prophet are here spoken of as having attained tothe highest spiritual stage; compare 89:27–30, where the same words occur regardingspiritual perfection; see 89:30a. This shows clearly that they were above all worldlymotives, and not only joined Islåm with the single object of pleasing God but also thattheir sincerity was above all reproach to the end, so that God was pleased with them andmade them enter His Garden."
