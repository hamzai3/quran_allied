    {
      "note": " 1a. See 26:1a for the explanation.\n\n      4a. By their deeds are meant the deeds which they ought to perform. Evil deeds are  made fairseeming to evildoers by the devil (6:43), while Allåh commends good deeds.  Elsewhere: “But Allåh has endeared the faith to you and has made it seemly in your hearts,  and He has made hateful to you disbelief and transgression and disobedience” (49:7).\n\n      8a. The words man f i-l-når have been explained in a number of ways. The best  explanation is that in which the word f ß (lit., in) may be rendered as meaning after or in  search of. Thus one of the explanations of the phrase given by AH is he who is in the  place or follows the direction in which the ﬁre appears to him to be burning, so that the  meaning is that Moses was blessed as also those who lived in this land. Rz says Moses  may be said to be fi-l-når, because of his nearness to the ﬁre, for he says that one who is  very near a thing is spoken of as being in it. According to another commentator, the  meaning is, he who is in search of it and after it. Still another explanation is that by man  is meant that or what, and the place where ﬁre was seen by Moses to be burning is meant.  The addition of the words those (or whatever is) around it is to show that the whole of  this land was blessed, because so many prophets for the guidance of humanity were  raised there.      That the ﬁre was not a physical ﬁre is suggested by commentators. This is in fact  clear. The voice that came to Moses was the voice of God and it came in the manner in  which the Divine call comes to all prophets. Moses received a Divine revelation, and  what he saw was in a state of transformation.\n\n       11a. The word illå with which this verse opens is here equivalent to wåw (i.e., and)  according to Mughnß. But as the negative lå in the previous passage, to which the latter is  conjoined, would be regarded as understood after wåw, hence the correct translation of  illå here is and not or nor. Others consider illå here as introducing a new statement (Bd).      12a. For the nine signs, see 7:133b.\n\n     15a. The history of David and Solomon, being the history of the temporal greatness  of the Israelites, forms really a part of the history of Moses, and reference to it is really  prophetical, to show that Islåm was also destined to rise to greatness temporally as well  as spiritually.\n\n       16a. The root word nuΔq, from which the word manΔiq is derived, signiﬁes originally  articulate speech or jointed voices uttered by the tongue and kept by the ears (R). Its use  with regard to other than human beings is looked upon as a kind of metaphor, and the  use of the word is allowable when one understands the signiﬁcance, though it may not  be articulate speech (R). Solomon’s understanding the speech of birds may imply the  use he made of birds in conveying messages from one place to another, these messages  being metaphorically called the speech of birds. See also next footnote. The reference  here is to the great resources of Solomon’s kingdom in his victorious marches against  near and distant enemies. Note also that Solomon does not speak of himself alone; his  people are included when he is made to say: We have been taught. This shows that his  people also knew that speech.\n\n      16b. By all things are meant all things pertaining to the needs of a strong kingdom.\n\n       17a. The hosts of Solomon are here divided into three classes, the jinn, the men, and  the Δair. As regards the jinn, it has been shown in 21:82a that these were men belonging  to certain mountain tribes whom Solomon had subjugated. Ôair may mean either birds  or horse, i.e., cavalry. The gathering together of all three classes and their division into  groups shows that all three were human beings. The word Δair, or Δå’ir, is derived from  Δåra, which indicates it ﬂew, and is applied not only to birds, but “is also said of other  things than those which have wings” (LL). Ôå’ir signiﬁes ﬂying thing, and as the root  word applies to other than winged beings, Δå’ir, of which Δair (the word used here) is a  plural, may also be applied to swift animals such as horses. Thus Δayyår, which is an  intensive form of Δå’ir, signiﬁes, when standing alone, a sharp, spirited, vigorous horse  that is almost made to ﬂy by reason of the vehemence of its running (T, LL). It also  means a company of men (LL). Ôayy∂r, which is another intensive form of the nomina-  tive Δå’ir, signiﬁes a man who is sharp and quick (Q, LL). Thus the context taken in the  light of these explanations would justify the conclusion that Δair here means horse, i.e.,  cavalry, because it could be moved quickly. This is corroborated by the  statement regarding Solomon’s love of horses in 38:31–33. But it may be added that the  use of birds in conveying messages made the birds a necessary adjunct to a military  expedition, and hence the word may also be taken literally as meaning birds.\n\n       18a. Many of the fables regarding Solomon have been due to a misconception of the  word naml. It should be noted that wådi-l-Naml cannot be properly translated as the val-  ley of the ants, for Naml is a proper noun, and according to T (see under the root wady),  the valley of the Naml is situated between Jibrßn and ‘Asqalån. And Namlah is the name  of a tribe, like Måzin, which literally signiﬁes the eggs of the ants. Namil means a clever  man (T). The name Namlah used also to be given to a child in whose hands an ant was  placed at its birth, because it was said such a child would be wise and intelligent (T).  And the Namlah are plainly spoken of as a tribe in the Qåm∂s, which says under the  word barq, Abriqah is of the waters of Namlah.\n\n     19a. Óå√ik means wondering, for ˙i√k is used as well for simple joy as for simple  wonder (R). See also LL, which says ˙a√aka signiﬁes also he wondered, synonym ‘ajiba.\n\n       20a. The opening words may mean either a review of birds or a review of horses; see  17a. By Hudhud is not to be understood the lapwing, but a person of that name. In every  language many of the proper names given to men will be found to be identical with the  names of animals. The Arab writers speak of a king of Himyar as Hudad (LA), which is  almost identical with Hudhud mentioned in the Qur’ån. The Bible speaks of a king of  Syria, named Ben Hadad (1 Kings 15:18, etc.). The Muntaha-l-arab states that Hudhad  was the name of the father of Balqßs, the queen of Sheba. According to LA, Hudhud is also  written as Hudåhad, and Hudåhad and Hadad was the name of a tribe in Yaman. This  shows that there is nothing strange in such a name being given to men. The verses that fol-  low show clearly that Solomon was speaking of one of his own ofﬁcers: the inﬂiction of  severe punishment on a small bird by such a mighty monarch, as Solomon, and the exposi-  tion of the great religious doctrine of Unity by the lapwing, are quite incomprehensible.\n\n      22a. Saba’ is the same as the Sheba of the Bible. The story as given here is not met  with in the Bible, but it was known to Jewish rabbis. The Bible speaks of the coming of  the queen of Sheba to Solomon with large presents to test him. See 1 Kings 10 and  2 Chron. 9. And later on it speaks of many strange women as Solomon’s wives (1 Kings 11).\n\n      26a. The recitation of this verse is followed by an actual prostration; see 7:206a.\n\n         36a. Why was Solomon angry on receiving a present from the queen? Later events,  as narrated further on, show that the present sent to Solomon was a throne which was  decorated either with nude art or with idolatrous paintings, or was offensive in some  other way. Solomon’s order in v. 38 to bring her throne to him shows clearly that by it  was meant the throne which she had sent to him as a present, and his order in v. 41 to  make alterations in this throne shows that the paintings on the throne were abhorrent to a  true worshipper of God.\n\n   38a. As usual, the narrative here omits the return of the messengers to the queen,  and her willingness to submit to Solomon on receiving the threat mentioned in the last  verse, and continues at the point where Solomon makes preparations to receive her. By  her throne is meant the throne which she had sent as a present.\n\n      39a. The rising up from the place does not signify his standing up from the sitting  posture, but his marching away from the place where he was at the time. The reference  to being trusty shows that the execution of the work required an honest worker. The  audacious jinn is apparently one of the Amalekites, who were men of large stature.\n\n      40a. By one having knowledge of the Book is meant an Israelite as against the  Amalekite referred to in the previous verses. The literal meaning of the concluding  words of the sentence is, before thy gaze returns to thee. It is the same as in the  twinkling of an eye, the idea conveyed being that he could do it without delay.\n\n      40b. Strange and curious legends are introduced by some commentators on the sup-  position that the events narrated took place in immediate succession. The words so when  he saw it settled beside him do not indicate that he saw it settled in the course of the  conversation given in the previous passage. It is an altogether different incident.\n\n      41a. As pointed out in 36a, Solomon was offended by the throne which the queen  sent him as a present because of the indecent or idolatrous paintings on it, and therefore  before she came to him, he caused certain alterations to be made in the throne. The  purpose of the alteration is given here in express words, whether she follows the right  way. In fact, she seems to have invited Solomon in the symbolic language of the  paintings on the throne to her religion of idolatry, and by making alterations Solomon  indicated that he could not make a compromise with idolatry.\n\n    42a. By putting the question, was thy throne like this? Solomon wanted to draw her  attention pointedly to the alterations made. The queen’s answer shows that her envoy  had already told her that Solomon was offended by the present which she had sent — we  were given the knowledge before about it. The submission referred to in the act of sur-  rendering her kingdom does not mean that she had turned a Muslim. This is made clear  in v. 43; she was prevented from becoming a true Muslim owing to her worship of the  sun. Hence submission to God comes later; see the concluding words of v. 44.\n\n       44a. The use of the word såq to signify difﬁculty or distress in many phrases is a com-  monplace of Arabic literature, and only crass ignorance of the Arabic language would make  anyone adopt the literal signiﬁcance of the word såq (i.e., shank) in the face of the recog-  nized idiomatic uses of the word. Al-kashf ‘ani-l-såq is a well-known idiom, and refers to a  man when difﬁculty befalls him — meaning he prepared himself for the difﬁculty — “they  mention the såq when they mean to express the difﬁculty of a case or an event, and to tell of  the terror occasioned thereby” (T, LL). Thus the statement in 68:42, yauma yukshafu ‘an  såq-in, means on a day when difﬁculty or calamity shall be disclosed (I‘Ab). And similarly,  qåmati-l-√arbu ‘alå såq-in signiﬁes the battle became vehement (LL). See also 68:42a,  where it is shown that the commentators attach the same signiﬁcance to these words.\n\n       44b. Solomon was a wealthy king and he had undoubtedly his palaces. It appears  that, in order to impress upon the queen that it was the unseen hand of God that worked  in nature, he made water to ﬂow under the smooth glass ﬂoor. Thus he conveyed to her  the message that God was the real force behind all in symbolic language, as she had con-  veyed to him the message of idolatry in the symbolic language of the throne which she  had sent him as a present. The queen mistook the glass for the water which ran beneath;  and when Solomon drew her attention to it, she at once realized her own error in wor-  shipping outward objects, like the sun, while the real force or the source of life was  Allåh, Whose hand worked in these objects. Perhaps in words, too, he impressed on her  the great message of Divine Unity. The result was that the queen accepted the religion of      44c, see next page.    Solomon — I submit with Solomon to Allåh, the Lord of the worlds.\n\n       44c. In this the Qur’ån contradicts the Bible, the latter holding that Solomon had  gone over to idol-worship on account of his non-Israelitish wives, while the Qur’ån  states that his wives were converts to his religion and believers in Divine Unity. Higher  criticism of the Bible upholds the Quranic view; see 2:102d.\n\n       48a. There is no doubt a reference here to the enemies of the Holy Prophet, the chief  of them being nine in number, eight of whom were slain at Badr, the exception was Ab∂  Lahab, who died at Makkah on hearing the news of the defeat at Badr. Their names were  Ab∂ Jahl, MuΔ‘im ibn ‘Adiyy, Shaibah ibn Rabß‘ah, ‘Utbah ibn Rabß‘ah, Walßd ibn  ‘Utbah, Umayyah ibn Khalf, Na˙ar ibn al-Ïarth, ‘Aqbah ibn Abß Mu‘aiΔ and Ab∂ Lahab.\n\n      49a. There seems to be a prophetical reference here to the plot against the Holy  Prophet, for the same plan was ultimately agreed upon by the Quraish to do away with  him. It should be borne in mind that the revelation of this chapter belongs to an early peri-  od. The plot against the Prophet’s life was to have been executed in the following manner:  One man from every tribe of the Quraish was selected, who should take the Prophet  unawares. They were to thrust their swords into his body simultaneously so that no partic-  ular tribe could be held guilty. This was agreed upon immediately before the Prophet’s  ﬂight to Madßnah, and thus the incident as relating to ˝åli√ is meant as a prophecy.\n\n  59 Say: Praise be to Allåh and peace  on His servants whom He has cho-  sen! Is Allåh better, or what they  associate (with Him)?\n\n       58a. Stones were rained on them; see 7:84a.\n\n       61a. See 25:53a.\n\n       62a. The manifestation of the marvellous power of God in nature, the creation of the  heavens and the earth, the sending down of rain, the making of rivers and mountains — all  these wonderful signs of the existence of the Great Creator are here followed by another  equally wonderful sign of the existence of God, the manifestation of His marvellous power  in man. But mark the contrast. This manifestation of the existence of God is not to be  sought in the greatness and power of man as the conqueror of the forces of nature, but in  his weakness in his great distress when, unable to ﬁnd help from any source, he throws  himself on the Divine threshold and seeks help from God. We are thus told that the mani-  festation of God’s great power in the mighty forces of nature is as clear an indication of  the existence of God as the manifestation of His power in a weak mortal who ﬁnds himself  in extreme distress. But what is more, this manifestation of God’s power is beautifully  mingled with prophecy — and He will make you successors in the earth. The distressed  ones here are no other than the Muslims, who were being cruelly persecuted and tortured,  and they are told that the manifestation of God’s power in making them rulers of the earth  would be as great as it was in His creation of the heavens and the earth. This also shows  the purpose underlying the narration of the histories of David and Solomon.\n\n       66a. Human knowledge cannot reach the life after death and God has vouchsafed  this knowledge to man through His revelation. But men are in doubt about it; in fact,  they shut their eyes to it.\n\n       80a. This verse is a clear testimony to what is meant by the Prophet’s raising the  dead; for here we are told that, if the dead go back retreating, the Prophet cannot make  them hear. Evidently this verse and the opening words of the following verse speak of  the reprobate who shut their eyes and close their ears to all truth.\n\n      82a. By the creature from the earth that will speak to them are evidently meant peo-  ple who are bent low upon earth. These people are the materialistic nations of the West  who have lost all sense of the higher values of life. The coming forth of the dåbbat al-  ar˙ is one of the signs of the approach of the Hour according to the Ïadßth. But the  Hour may mean either the day of Judgment or the doom of a people, and this verse gives  us an indication that the Hour in this case stands for the doom of a nation; because here  it is spoken of as being a punishment for not believing in the Divine messages.\n\n      87a. As a foretaste of what was in store for the rejectors of the Truth, the prophecy  was also brought to fulﬁlment in this life. The whole of Arabia recognized the Holy  Prophet as its temporal and spiritual head, and the proud opponents were abased.\n\n     88a. That jabal signiﬁes a great man has been shown in 13:31a. That in the passing  away of the mountains there is a clear reference to the removal of the mighty men who  opposed the Prophet’s preaching is also shown by the concluding words of the verse, which  clearly speak of the punishment of the evil deeds by One Who is Aware of what they do.\n\n      91a. The statement here that the Prophet is commanded to serve the Lord of the city  of Makkah contains an allusion that the servant of the Lord will be the lord of that city.\n\n      93a. Mark the ﬁrmness of the tone in which the showing of signs is asserted.      "
