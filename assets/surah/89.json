      "note": "4a. There is a great variety of opinion as to what is meant by the daybreak, the tennights, and the even and the odd. I think the reference is to the importance attached toMakkah (which is mentioned as The City in the commencement of the next chapter),because it was not only the spiritual centre of Arabia, but had also become its trade centre,on account of pilgrims resorting to it from all parts of Arabia. The daybreak would thussignify the daybreak of the first of the month of Dhu-l-Ïijjah; the ten nights would standfor the first ten nights of that month, the tenth day being the day of sacrifices. According toanother interpretation, the ten nights are the last ten nights of the month of Rama˙ån, inwhich occurs the lailat al-qadr. By the even and the odd, according to a √adßth, is meantthe prayer which consists of even and odd rak‘ahs (Tr. 44:89). Others however say that byshaf‘ is meant the creation, which consists all of pairs (51:49) and by watr (odd) is meantthe Creator (RM). The whole is a warning to the people of Makkah that, if they do notheed the warning, their end will be the same as the end of previous rejectors of truth.\n\n7a. Iram or Aram was, according to one account, the name of the grandfatherof ‘Åd, from whom the tribe took its name, and according to another, the name of a cityin which it lived. The ‘Åd are here called dhåt al-‘imåd, the word ‘imåd meaninglofty buildings, supported by columns. But dhåt al-‘imåd may also mean possessingtallness (LL).\n\n13a. SauΔ signifies primarily the mixing of one thing with another (R). It then comesto signify a whip, but here it means a portion or a share (LL), the significance being thatthey received a portion of the punishment here, greater punishment overtaking themafter death.\n\n16a. As a general statement, it means that God tries man both by granting himaffluence, in which case he is puffed up with pride and says that his wealth is an indication that God honours him, and by poverty, in which case he thinks that God has disgraced him. But wealth is no indication of a man’s honour.\n\n18a. Vv. 17 and 18, as also the 19th, show how the Prophet felt for the orphans, thepoor and the weak, so much so that he warns his powerful and wealthy opponents thattheir indifference to the orphans and the poor and their injustice to the weak will bringdown upon them the Divine judgment, which will shatter their power. As he was in thebeginning so he remained to the end, a true well-wisher of the weak and the oppressed.And when he became the head of a State, he provided for the orphans and the poor outof the public funds, thus forestalling the Poor Laws and Old Age Pensions by thirteencenturies; see 9:60.\n\n19a. Among the Arabs, women and young children were not allowed to have anyshare in the inheritance, because they could not fight the enemy.\n\n23a. The crumbling to pieces of the earth, the coming of the Lord with angels, andthe appearance of hell, refer equally to the punishment in this life as to that in the next.\n\n23b. Being “mindful” is of no use to a man when punishment overtakes him.\n\n26a. These words indicate the severity of the punishment.\n\n30a. The concluding verses of this chapter refer to the highest stage of the spiritualdevelopment of man, the stage in which he rests contented with his Lord, and finds his quietude, his happiness, and his delight in Him. This is the heavenly life. It has alreadybeen noted — see 12:53a and introductory note to ch. 75 — that the Holy Qur’ån recognizes three stages in spiritual development, the ammårah or the animal stage (12:53),the lawwåmah or the human stage (75:2), and the muΔma‘innah or the heavenly or spiritual stage, mentioned here. At this last stage, the pure and perfect sincerity, truth andrighteousness of a person are rewarded by Almighty God by granting him a heaven onthis earth. All others look to a prospective paradise, but he enters paradise in this verylife. It is at this stage, too, that a person realizes that the prayers and worship which atfirst appeared to him as a burden are really a nourishment on which the growth of hissoul depends, and that this is the basis of his spiritual development. The spirit — whichin the second stage, although blaming a man for the impurities of life, is yet powerless toresist the evil tendencies, or to blot them out wholly, and too infirm to establish a manupon the principle of virtue with firmness — now reaches a stage of development inwhich its efforts are crowned with success. The state of struggle with sinful propensitiespasses away, an entire change comes over the nature of man, and the former habitsundergo a complete transformation."
