    {
      "note": "2a. By the resurrection is here meant the spiritual resurrection of the Arabs, to bebrought about through the Prophet. The primary significance of qiyåmah is only rising:“Al-qiyåmah originally signifies the rising of a man all at once” (R). Al-qiyåmah is nowa term which is synonymous with the great Resurrection, but it has not lost its originalsignificance, and means also the rising to life of those who are spiritually dead. The lå(nay) in the beginning of verse 1 and verse 2 carries the same significance as in 4:65.According to Kf, lå in such cases is to give emphasis to the oath. For the nafslawwåmah, see introductory note above.\n\n3a. The gathering of the bones stands for a new life. Man wonders as to how he willbe raised to life when his flesh is eaten and he has become bones. The answer to thisquestion is given in the next verse.\n\n4a. The word banån primarily means only the fingers, or the ends of the fingers, butis also applicable to all members of the body (LL), and therefore might also be translated as the whole make of his body. But even if the primary significance, fingers, be adopted, the meaning will still be the same, because the superiority of man lies in his hand,and especially in the make of his fingers, without which his advancement would havebeen impossible. God, Who made a complete man out of nothing, we are here told, hasalso the power to give life to bones or to raise him a second time.\n\n7a. Bariqa means he became confounded and unable to see his right course (LL).Some great calamity is implied which would confound the opponents. Some commentators take these to be the signs of the approach of the death of a person (Rz).\n\n8a. The darkening of the moon may imply either a lunar eclipse, for which see thenext note, or it may mean the total darkening of the moon, which may imply the totaldisruption of the present system.\n\n9a. The bringing together of the sun and the moon implies the disappearance of thelight of both. It may be a partial disappearance, as in the case of an eclipse, and in thatcase the reference may be to what is stated in a report relating to the appearance of theMahdß, in whose time the sun and the moon will both be eclipsed in the month ofRama˙ån (Baihaqß). The name of the Messiah and Mahdß being associated with the finaltriumph of Islåm in the world, we are thus told that Islåm will not only triumph inArabia but in the whole of the world at a later period in its history. If the total disappearance of the light of both the sun and the moon is meant, the reference would be to thefinal disruption of the solar system, and the manifestation of the Greater Resurrection.\n\n13a. What he sent before implies the evil deeds which he did but ought not to havedone; what he put off being the good deeds which he failed to do but which he ought tohave done.\n\n16a. The preceding verses speak of the distress which must befall those who do notforsake the wrong course. The Prophet naturally desired to make it clear to them, andtherefore, he was anxious that the warning should be given immediately in plainerwords. So, he is told not to make haste with it. Hence the statement made in the versesthat follow, viz., that the recitation and collection of the whole of the Qur’ån, togetherwith its effective explanation to the opponents, were matters which Allåh had decided tobring about, and the Prophet should have no anxiety on that account. Compare 20:113,114: “And thus have We sent it down an Arabic Qur’ån, and have distinctly set forththerein of threats that they may guard against evil, or that it may be a reminder for them... And make not haste with the Qur’ån before its revelation is made complete to thee,and say: My Lord, increase me in knowledge”.\n\n17a. There can be no clearer evidence that the collection of the verses into chapters andof the chapters into one whole is here claimed by the Qur’ån to be a matter which, like itsrevelation, was to be entirely carried out under Divine guidance by the Holy Prophet himself. The Holy Book was thus from the first intended to be arranged and collected into onewhole. It is curious to observe that Rodwell, who has paid little regard to the proper andorderly arrangement of the Qur’ån, is constrained to remark in a footnote to this verse: “Ineither case we are led to the conclusion that from the first Mu√ammad had formed the planof promulgating a written book”. But the words of the Qur’ån clearly indicate much more;the collection of the Qur’ån was to be accomplished under Divine guidance, and collectionincludes the arrangement of the parts. In fact, it could not be called a book unless its variousportions were arranged into one whole. On the other hand, if the order of revelation were tobe followed in the arrangement of its parts, its collection would not have been spoken of assomething distinct from its revelation, which is implied in the word recitation.\n\n23a. As that day represents both the day of the breathing of the life spiritual hereand the day of the Resurrection, the words looking to their Lord have also a double significance, indicating looking to the Lord for their reward in the former case, and, thehighest bliss of all, the sight of the Lord in the Hereafter. It should be noted that thesight of the Lord does not imply that the Lord will have a body; it is not with the material eye that the Lord will be seen, but by the spiritual eye, which the righteous will possess on the day of Resurrection.\n\n25a. Note that this great disaster also befell them in this life, and thus it demonstrated the truth of the Hereafter.\n\n27a. Man råq-in means who will ascend with it? Will the angels of mercy ascend withit or the angels of punishment? (T, R). But råq also means a charmer; also a physician (IJ);the significance being, Where is the charmer or the physician that could avert the doom?\n\n29a. For såq, meaning affliction, see 27:44a\n\n31a. The description applies to every opponent.\n\n35a. The haughty opponent is warned that destruction is very near. Or, the meaningis, Woe to thee! The repetition shows that the opponents were threatened with a doublepunishment, viz., in this life and in the Hereafter (Rz). In fact, the double punishment isspoken of throughout the chapter.\n\n36a. The verse draws attention to the seriousness of life and to man’s responsibilityfor his actions — a doctrine denied as much today as it was by the Arabs.\n\n40a. The giving of “life to the dead” not only signifies raising after death, but alsospiritually raising a dead people to life."
