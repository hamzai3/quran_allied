	  "note": "1a. Lailat al-Qadr, literally the Night of Majesty or Grandeur or Greatness, is a    well-known night in the last ten days of the month of Rama˙ån, being more probably the    25th or 27th or 29th night of the month. In 44:3 it is called the blessed night. From    2:185, it appears that the Holy Qur’ån was revealed in the month of Rama˙ån, and from    the above it appears to have been revealed on the lailat al-Qadr; by revelation of course    being meant the commencement of its revelation, because the whole was revealed in    portions during twenty-three years; and the word “Qur’ån” is applicable as well to a portion as to the whole. That the reference is here to the commencement of the revelation is    also clear from the arrangement of the chapters, the opening verses of the last chapter    being admittedly the first revelation to the Prophet. In fact, lailat al-Qadr owes its    importance to the fact it was on this night that the most blessed and perfect of all revelations was vouchsafed to the world. Moses’ fasting for forty days previous to the receipt    of revelation (Exod. 24:18), and Jesus’ keeping fast for the same number of days before    he was called upon to undertake the office of prophethood (Matt. 4:2), show that Divine    blessings are associated with fasting in sacred history. Hence the Muslims are required    to fast every year for thirty days, and special Divine blessings are promised to them in    the concluding days of the fasts.\n\n    3a. A thousand months may be taken as the equivalent of a very long time. Numeri -cally they are equal to about 83 years, leaving 17 years to complete a century. There is asaying of the Holy Prophet according to which a mujaddid, or a reformer, will appearamong the Muslims at the commencement of every century. The lailat al-Qadr being a timeof great spiritual blessing may also signify the time during which the Prophet worked inperson, being actually a period of twenty-three years, or the time during which a mujaddidwould ordinarily work, which period is more blessed spiritually than the rest of the century.\n\n4a. The Spirit here may signify the Divine Spirit, which is really the force throughwhich the regeneration of humanity is brought about, or it may mean Divine inspiration.The descent of the angels and the Spirit also shows that lailat al-Qadr, as hinted at in thelast note, has a deeper significance, for though a particular night in the month of Rama˙ånmay be characterized by great Divine blessings, it is more especially in connection with themission of one appointed by Allåh for the regeneration of the world that “the angels and theSpirit” come down from heaven, turning men’s minds to the spiritual values of life.\n\n5a. “Peace” is the distinctive mark of lailat al-Qadr. This peace comes to the heartsof the true devotees in the form of a tranquillity of mind which makes them fit to receiveDivine blessings. But it is also through one commissioned by God that the basis of peaceamong men is laid."
