    {
      "note": "1a. The short Makkan chapters, which are no doubt generally among the earliestrevelations of the Holy Prophet, often speak most forcibly of the greatness and glory ofAllåh. The statement here that the Kingdom is in Allåh’s hand and that He has powerover all things is like a prophetical statement as to the establishment of the kingdom ofIslåm, which was really the kingdom of God. This is made clear by what Jesus Christsaid: “The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forththe fruits thereof” (Matt. 21:43).\n\n2a. The law of life and death or growth and decay works throughout nature, but ithas a special meaning in reference to man, because death does not end his life, but isreally the starting-point for a new life of spiritual progress. Life to him below is, therefore, a trial, i.e., a means of bringing to light his hidden qualifications for the performance of good. But life and death have another and a deeper significance for man in thelife and death of nations. Nations that work evil are swept away, and others are raised intheir place that they may do good.\n\n3a. You say, such a thing is Δabq or Δibåq of that, meaning that this thing is thematch of that or conforms or corresponds with that or is the like of that (LL). This significance, moreover, suits the context, for the verse goes on to describe the uniformityprevailing in nature.\n\n3b. Attention is here called to the regularity and uniformity of the laws working innature. There is no incongruity, so that things belonging to the same class should be subject to different laws, nor is there a disorder (fuΔ∂r, which R translates as meaning ikhtilål,i.e., disorder and laxity), so that a law should not work uniformly. The verse, while calling attention to the existence of a Supreme Being, as witnessed in the regularity and uniformity of the laws working in creation, draws special attention to spiritual laws, whichalso work uniformly, and thus evil and good must each bring its special reward.\n\n5a. The lamps with which the lower heaven is lighted, i.e., the stars, are made themeans of conjectures regarding the future by the astrologers. Ruj∂m is the plural of rajm,and explaining it IAth says: “Rajm means conjectures about what Allåh has not stated ”(N). And classing the munajjim, i.e., the astrologer, and the kåhin, i.e., the diviner, andthe så√ir, i.e., the magician, as one, he goes on to say: “Thus he (i.e., the Prophet, whosesaying is explained) considered the astrologer, who learns about stars so that he mayjudge thereby, and attributes to them the effect of good and evil, to be a disbeliever” (N).Explaining these very words, Råghib says: “And rajm is used metaphorically to signifyconjectures and surmises” (R). LL also gives this significance of the verse on the authority of Bd and TA: “We have made them to be means of conjectures to the devils ofmankind, i.e., to the astrologers”. Thus the astrologers, who deceived people by tellingthem many things which they posed as having learned from the stars, are referredto here.\n\n16a. God is spoken of here as being in heaven; elsewhere He is spoken of as beingin heaven and earth alike (43:84); and again He is spoken of as being “with you wherever you are” (57:4). The one thing certain is that God is not in one particular place to theexclusion of other places. Punishment sent by God is often spoken of as coming fromheaven, and it is in reference to the punishment of the deniers of truth that He is spokenof here as being in heaven, or above all, so that none can avert the punishment sent byHim.\n\n17a. The word √å©ib has already been explained in 17:68a. It is derived from √å©abmeaning stones or pebbles that are thrown and means a violent wind that raises dust andpebbles (LL). In the well-known Battle of the Allies, when an army of twenty thousandwas besieging Madßnah and the Muslims were almost helpless against this mighty force,it was a violent wind which put all the hosts to flight; see 33:9b.\n\n19a. Yumsiku-hunna may mean uphold them or withhold them. The withholding ofthe birds signifies the delay of the punishment, for the birds are spoken of as following avictorious army; see 16:79a. The question in the next verse as to who will help themcorroborates this significance.\n\n21a. This is also a prophecy. Their sustenance was withheld in the great faminewhich prevailed at Makkah, prophecies regarding which are met with in the HolyQur’ån in early as well as later revelation; see 44:10a.\n\n22a. One going “prone upon his face” is one who stumbles and falls at every step.Such a one is he who is not guided by truth.\n\n28a. The meaning is that the guilty will by all means be called to account and sufferthe evil consequences of what they have done, whether the Prophet and his companionslive or die, but the uncertainty as to the reward of the righteous is at once removed bythe words rather He will have mercy on us. For au, meaning rather, see LL."
