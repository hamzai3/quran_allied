      "note": "1a. It should be noted that the reason given for not taking the disbelievers as friendsis that they are the enemies of Allåh and His Messenger, who drove out the Prophet andthe Muslims from their homes. Vv. 8 and 9 afford a full explanation.\n\n2a. That is, they would slay you with their hands and revile you with their tongues.\n\n4a. As shown in 6:74a, it was not Abraham’s father for whom he thus prayed, forultimately this sire of Abraham proved to be a deadly enemy. Abraham’s example isquoted to show how loving and tender he was towards his people, yet, when it becameclear to him that they were bent upon uprooting the Truth, even Abraham could notmaintain relations of friendship with them. The Holy Prophet and his companions werein like manner now obliged to renounce all relationships of friendship with a people whowere not only the avowed enemies of the Muslims but also in a state of continual warwith them. For Abraham’s promise to ask forgiveness for his sire, see 19:47.\n\n7a. This verse makes it clear that the prohibition against friendly relations with thedisbelievers was only temporary, to be operative only so long as the war continued. Thefriendship prophetically referred to here was brought about after the conquest of Makkah.\n\n8a. This verse and the one that follows, revealed as they were at a time when therelations between the Muslims and the disbelievers were most strained on account of theexistence of a continual state of war between the two parties, settle conclusively thatfriendly relations between Muslims and non-Muslims, as such, are not prohibited. It is inthe light of these verses that all the verses forbidding friendly relations with the disbelievers should be read, because here the true principle is revealed in unmistakable language, allowing friendly relations with one class of disbelievers and prohibiting suchrelations with those of another class.\n\n10a. People continued to embrace Islåm at Makkah, although there was now nopreacher of the faith there. This gradual conversion to Islåm continued notwithstandingthe bitter persecution of the new converts, which compelled them to flee from theirhomes. It is an unparalleled example of the deep impression which the Holy Prophet’struth had made upon the Makkans. The example cited here relates to believing womenwho fled to Madßnah under these circumstances. These women were not taken unconditionally; it was necessary that they should be examined. In accordance with this injunction we find it related that the Holy Prophet obtained the assurance of such women underoath that they had not left their homes except on account of Islåm, and that it was not thedesertion of their husbands or the love of anyone that had prompted them to flee (JB, Kf ).\n\n10b. The state of permanent warfare maintained between the Muslims and thedisbelievers did not allow of any social relationship to be established between the two parties. Hence marriage relationship, between Muslim men and disbelieving women, aswell as those between Muslim women and the disbelieving men, could no longer bemaintained; each party having returned the dowry, divorce automatically resulted.\n\n11a. It is a case in which a Muslim husband is allowed to recoup the loss sustainedof the dowry of a disbelieving wife who has deserted him, from the sum due for the payment of dowry for a Muslim woman who has fled from the disbelievers and joined theMuslims, or from acquisitions gained in war (Kf). This was necessary because the disbelievers refused to return the dowries of women who had gone over to them.\n\n12a. Most of the commentators think that the pledge spoken of in this verse wasonly taken by the Holy Prophet after the conquest of Makkah, when large numbers ofwomen as well as men embraced Islåm.\n\n13a. The reference is to the Jews. One sect of the Jews denied the Resurrection, towhich reference is contained in the concluding words of the verse."
