	  "note": "1a. The great victory which had come was the triumph of the religion of Islåm in thewhole of Arabia. Deputation after deputation from all parts of Arabia came to Madßnahand accepted Islåm. History does not present another example of the wonderful transformation wrought by the Prophet within the short space of twenty years.\n\n3a. On witnessing the greatest triumph known to history, the Prophet is told to celebrate the praise of his Lord, and to ask protection. For whom was protection to be asked?If it was for himself, it was a protection against elation at an unprecedented victory,because elation ill befitted a Teacher of righteousness. But more likely, he was requiredto ask protection for the masses which were now accepting Islåm in companies. In fact hewas required to ask Divine forgiveness or protection for his erstwhile oppressors, forgiveness for his deadly enemies, who were guilty of the gravest crimes."
