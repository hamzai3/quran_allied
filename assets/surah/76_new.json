      "note": "3a. The right way is shown clearly; it is for man himself to walk in it and thus bethankful, or away from it and thus be unthankful. Or the meaning may be he may acceptor reject.\n\n4a. See 69:32a.\n\n5a. The original for camphor is kåf ∂r, which is derived from kafr meaning to coveror to suppress. Medically camphor is a cool and refreshing aromatic, but here it is usedin reference to its original significance. The cup of which the righteous drink is the cupof the love of Allåh, and its mixture with kåf ∂r is to indicate that by this cup all lowdesires and sexual passions which lead man away from the path of righteousness aresuppressed, in the same manner as poisonous matter is suppressed by camphor. Manneeds an intoxication and for it he generally resorts to alcoholic drinks, which bring intheir train evil and slavery to sexual passions. The Prophet intoxicated his followers withthe love of Allåh, and as a result of this, their evil tendencies were altogether suppressed. Vv. 7 and 8 show clearly that it is of the change brought about in this very lifethat the Holy Qur’ån is speaking here. In the spiritual advancement of man this is thefirst stage, because it is not until the evil tendencies of man are completely suppressedthat he is able to advance to the higher stages of spiritual perfection.\n\n6a. The fountain from which the servants of Allåh drink is the fountain of the love ofGod referred to in the previous verse. It is not a cup which may be exhausted with onedraught; it is a fountain. The faithful are here spoken of as the servants of Allåh — ‘ibådAllåh — because an ‘abd is really one who is entirely lost in the love of God. But herewe are further told that they not only drink of it themselves but they make it to flowforth in such abundance that others also may partake of it.\n\n9a. The fulfilment of vows spoken of in v. 7 is in relation to the service of God, orthe act of bringing themselves closer and closer to God, while the feeding of the poorspoken of here is in relation to the service of humanity. Thus they combine the service ofGod with the service of humanity. The words for Allåh’s pleasure (Ar., wajh) clearlyshow that it is of the love of God that these verses speak. Man worships Allåh for the loveof Allåh, but the Holy Qur’ån requires him to serve humanity also for the love of Allåh.\n\n16a. That is, everyone will receive them according to the measure of his deeds.\n\n17a. The Arabic word for ginger is zanjabßl. It is said to have a property that isheating or warming, strengthening to the venereal faculty, clearing to the phlegm,sharpening to the intellect and exhilarating (LL). The first cup of the love of God is spoken of in v. 5, as being tempered with camphor and bringing about suppression of evil,and this second cup is now spoken of as strengthening and exhilarating, i.e., enablingman to perform great and noble deeds. The love of God thus not only suppresses the evilinclinations of man, but also enables him to attain a still higher stage of spiritualadvancement, giving him the strength to perform wonderful deeds of self-sacrifice.\n\n18a. Salsabßl means easy, sweet, rapid-flowing (R). According to some it is made upof sal, meaning ask thou, and sabßl, way, as if it meant, Ask thy Lord a way to it. It isnow applied to an artificial fountain throwing up water (LL).\n\n19a. Because these are heavenly blessings, and decay cannot overtake them; see56:17a.\n\n20a. The word thamma — it is different from thumma — meaning there or thither isused here in reference to the spiritual kingdom which is granted to the faithful. They aregranted blessings and a great kingdom in this life as well, to which man shuts his eyeson account of his ignorance. Note, however, that the faithful followers of the Prophetwere granted material blessings and a great temporal kingdom as well, a kingdom whichthey inherited from the Prophet himself and which subsists to this day, and is indeedwidening daily.\n\n21a. As they led pure lives here, they were made to drink a pure drink in this verylife. They will have a pure drink in the Hereafter, too, the heavenly life being the purestthat can be imagined.\n\n24a. This shows that the blessings mentioned in the previous section will also find amanifestation in this life; the Divine judgment will bring about the fall of one party andthe rise of another.\n\n28a. The mention of the grievous day in the previous verse and the statement herethat another people will take the place of these are clear prophecies for this life. Hence itis called a warning in the verse that follows.\n\n30a. As the context clearly shows, the faithful are spoken of here; the previous versestates that whoever will, let him take a way to his Lord, and the verse that follows refersto the faithful in the words, He admits whom He pleases to His mercy. The meaning isthat true and sincere believers have so completely submitted themselves to the Divinewill and are so completely resigned that they have no desires of their own, and all theirdesires are in accordance with Allåh’s pleasure.Taking the words as a general statement, there can still be little doubt as to their realsignificance. The chapter opens with the clear statement, We have truly shown him theway; he may be thankful or unthankful; so that man has not been constrained by God toadopt a particular course, whether for good or for evil. The end of the chapter is equallyclear: Surely this is a Reminder; so whoever will, let him take a way to his Lord. Thewords — you will not, unless Allåh please — therefore mean that man’s choice wouldhave no effect, if it did not please Allåh. We can easily see that there are two things necessary for the guidance of man: firstly, the revelation of the Reminder by Allåh, and secondly, the acceptance of that Reminder by man. If Allåh had not pleased to reveal theReminder, man’s choice would have been nowhere."
